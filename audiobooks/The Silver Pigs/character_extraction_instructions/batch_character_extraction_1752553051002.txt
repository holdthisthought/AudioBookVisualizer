=== CHAPTER 2: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 2 ===
 CHAPTER II Fortunately, he was leaving. I stowed the girl in her basket-weaver's portico while I crouched down behind her and fiddled with the straps of the left boot. Who is it? She whispered. Just a blotch of local slime, I told her. I spared her my speech about property magnets as parasites on the poor, but she took the point. He's your landlord! Smart. He's gone? She confirmed it. Taking no chances I asked five or six skinny gladiators at his heels? All black eyes and dirty bandages! Come on then! We pushed through the wet garments, Linear was allowing to dry up in the street, turning our faces away as they flapped back at us, then went in. Linear's laundry. Steam billowed out to flatness. Wash your boys, stamp the clothes, splashing up to their cracked little knees in hot tubs. There was a great deal of noise, slapping the linen, thumping and pounding it, clanging cauldrons, all in a close echoing atmosphere. The laundry took up the whole ground floor, spilling out into the courtyard at the back. We were greeted with derision by the slip-shod proprietess. Linear was probably younger than me, but she looked forty, with a gaunt face and a slack stomach that rolled over the edge of the basket she was carrying. Whisps of frizzled hairs escaped from a colourless ribbon around her head. She cackled with fruity laughter when she saw my honey cake. Thalco! Does your mother let you play with little girls? Ornamentally, I adopted a slaw of expression. Borg and I picked up in the forum. Don't ship her pretty glaze, linear scoffed. Smirractor could slip to hint, pay up, or his fischerboys would be poking their trodons up your delicate parts. If he wants to ring out my arm-purs, he should render a written account. Tell him, tell him yourself! Linear, whose instinct must have been to favour me, kept well clear of my tussle with the landlord. Smirractors paid a certain attention, which at present she was resisting because she liked her independence, but as a good businesswoman she kept her options open. He was foul. I thought Linear was mad. I told her what I'd thought. She had told me whose business I could mind. Her restless gaze flickered again towards my companion. A new client, I boasted. Really? She paid you for the experience? Or you pay enough for the treat? We both turned to survey my young lady. She wore a fine white undertunic, fixed along the sleeves with blue enamel clasps, and over it a sleeveless gown so generous in length it was bunched up over a hurdle of woven gold threads. Apart from the wide bands of patent embroidery at a neck and hem, and in broad stripes down the front, I could tell from the narrowing of Linear's watery eyes we were admiring a quality cloth. My goddess had wire hoops threaded with tiny glass beads in each neat little ear, a couple of chain necklaces, three bracelets on her left arm, four on her right, and various finger rings in the form of knots, serpents or birds with long crossbeaks. We could have sold her girlish finery for more than I earned last year. It was best not to consider how much a brothel keeper might pay us for the pretty wench. She was blonde. Well, she was blonde that month, and since she was hardly from Macedonia or Germany, die must have helped. It was cleverly done. I'd never have known, but Linear informed me afterwards. Her hair had been curled into three soft fat ringlets tied in a clump with a ribbon at the nape of a neck. The temptation to untie that ribbon niggled me like a hornet bite. She painted her face, of course. All my sisters turn themselves out, spanking with colour like newly gilt statues, so I was used to that. My sisters are amazing, but blatant works of art. This was much more subtle, invisibly achieved, except that running in the heat had left one eye very faintly smudged. Her eyes were brown, set wide apart, and sweetly without guile. Linear tide of looking long before I did. Cradle snatcher. She told me, frankly, tinkle in the bucket before you take her up. This was not a request for a medical sample, because cradle-snatching made Linear Diagnosmi as unwell. It was a straight, hospitable offer with business overtones. I shall have to explain about the bucket and the bleach fat. A long time afterwards I described all this to someone I knew well, and we discussed what laundras use for whitening cloth. Distilled wood ash, my companions, suggested doubtfully. They do use ash. They also use carbonate of soda, full of earth, and pipe clay for the brilliant robes of election candidates. But the pristine togas of our magnificent empire are effectively bleached with urine, obtained from the public latrines. The emperor Vespasian, never slow to light on brisk new ways of squeezing out cash, had slapped attacks on this ancient trade in human waste. Linear paid the tax, though on principle she increased her supply for nothing whenever she could. The woman I'd been telling the story to commented in her cool way, I suppose in the salad season, when everyone's eating beetroot, half the togas in the forum are a delicate hue of pink. Do they rinse it out, she inquired? I shrugged in a deliberately vague way. I would have skipped this unsavory detail, but as it turned out eventually, Linia's bleach fat was critical to the tail. Since I lived six floors up in a block that was no better equipped than any other slum in room, Linia's bucket had long been my welcome friend. Linia offered my visitor, not unkindly. Girlie scow behind the cart in rails dear. Linia, don't embarrass my dandy client. I was blushing on her behalf. Actually I'd left home rather suddenly. Dainty, but desperate. My client shot behind the rods where the dried clothes were hung on poles through shoulders to be stretched down with teasels to bring up the nap. While I waited, I topped up my usual bucket and talked to Linia about the weather, as one does. After five minutes I ran out of weather. Get lost, Falco. A card in girl greeted me as I peered around the rails. No sign of my client. Had she been less attractive, I might have let her go. She was extremely attractive, and I saw no reason to part with that sort of innocence to anybody else. Curseing now, I barged past the giant screw clothes presses and out to the laundry yard. There was a furnace heating the well water used in the wash. There were garments spread over wicker frames above braziers of burning suffer, which through some mysterious chemistry smokes in additional whiteness. There were several use scoffing at my fury, and there was a dreadful smell. There was no client. I hopped over a hand-cart and set off fast down the lane. She'd scampered past the direz lamp-black ovens, braved the mitten, and was halfway along the poultry cages where some foot-saw geese and her drooping series flamingo rested for market the next day. As I approached, she pulled up short, her way blocked by a rope-maker, who was unbuckling his belt from his eighteen-stone girth, to ease the task of raping her with that casual brutality which passed in these parts for appreciation of the female form. I politely thanked the rope-maker for looking after her, then before either of them could haggle, I brought her back. This was one client, whose contract would need to be enforced by tying her to my wrist with a long piece of string.

=== CHAPTER 3: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 3 ===
 Chapter Three After the hum of the forum and the hurly-burly of the Roman squares, the Falco apartment was blessedly still. Though faint noises rose from the street below, an occasional bird song could be heard across the acres of red-tiled roofs. I lived right at the top. We arrived, as did all comers, wearily gasping for breath. The girls stopped to read my ceramic finger-plate. A finger-plate was unnecessary since no one climbs six flights unless they know who lives upstairs, but I'd taken pity on a travelling salesman who flogged up to persuade me it would help business to advertise. Nothing helps my business, but never mind. M. Didius Falco. M. for Marcus? Shall I call you Marcus? No, I said. We went in. More steps, less rent, I explained wryly. I lived on the roof until the pigeons complained I was lowering the tone of their pantiles. I lived half-way to the sky. The girl was entranced. Used only to desirable spreads at ground-floor level, with her own gardens and access to the aqueducts, she probably missed the disadvantages of my eagle's nest. I dreaded that the foundations would collapse and six layers of habitation collapse in a puff of plaster dust, or that one blazing night I would sleep through the fire-watcher's alarm and fry on my own fat. She made a beeline for the balcony. I gave her a moment and then went out to join her, genuinely proud of my view. The view, at least, was fabulous. Our block stood high enough on the Aventine to see over its neighbours towards the Probus Bridge. You could spy for miles, out across the river and the Trans-Siberina sector, to the Aneculan Mount and the West Coast countryside. It was best at night. Once the delivery carts stopped their racket, sounds became so intense you could hear the water lapping on the tiber's banks and the emperor's sentries grounding their spears behind you on the Palatine Hill. She breathed deeply of the warm air, rich in city smells, cook-shops and chandeliers, and the aromatic waft from the stone pines in the public gardens on Princeian Hill. Oh, I wish I lived somewhere like this. She must have seen my face. Condemned as a pampered rat, you suppose I don't realise you have no water, no winter heat and no proper oven so you have to carry in your meals from the hot pie shop? She was right. I had supposed that. Dropping her voice, she sprang on me. Who are you? You read it. Didius Falco, I said, watching her. I'm a private informer. She considered this. For a moment she was uncertain. Then she became quite excited. You work for the emperor. Vespasian hates informers. I operate for sad middle-aged men who think their wicked wives are sleeping with charioteers, and even sadder ones who know their wives are sleeping with their nephews. Sometimes for women. What do you do for the women? Or is it indiscreet to ask? I laughed. Whatever they pay for. I left it at that. I went inside and tidied away various items I preferred her not to see. Then I set about preparing my evening meal. After a time she followed me in and inspected the bleak hole Smaractus rented me. For the price, it was an insult, but I rarely paid his price. There was an outer room in which a dog might just turn round, if he was a thin dog with his tail between his legs, a wonky table, a slanty bench, a shelf of pots, a bank of bricks I used as a cooking stove, a gridiron, wine jars, empty, rubbish basket, full. One way out to the balcony for when you got tired of stamping on the cockroaches indoors, plus a second opening behind a curtain in bright welcoming stripes. This led to the bedroom. Sensing it, perhaps, she did not ask. In case you're used to all-night banquets that run through seven courses from eggs in fish pickle sauce to frozen sorbets dug out of snow pits, I warn you, on Tuesdays my cook goes to see his granny. I had no cook, no slaves at all. My new client was beginning to look unhappy. Please don't trouble. I can eat when you take me home. You're going nowhere yet, I said, not until I know what I'm taking you back to. Now eat. We had fresh sardines. I would have liked to provide something more exciting, but sardines were what the woman who took it upon herself to leave my meals had left. I made a cold sweet sauce to liven up the fish. Honey, with a dash of this, a sprinkle of that, the normal sort of thing. The girl watched me do it as if she'd never seen anybody grinding lovage and rosemary in a mortar in her life. Perhaps she never had. I finished first, then leaned my elbows on the edge of the table while I gazed at the young lady with a frank and trustworthy face. Now, tell your uncle Didius all about it. What's your name? Helena. I was so busy looking frank I missed the flush on her own face that order have told me the seed pearl in this oyster was a fake. No, those barbarians, Helena? No. So they grabbed you where? In our house. I whistled slowly. That was a surprise. Remembering made her indignant, which made her more talkative. They'd snatched her in broad daylight. They clanged the bell as bold as brass, barged past the porter, burst through the house, pulled me out to a carrying chair and raced down the street. When we got to the forum the crowd slowed them so I jumped out and ran away. They'd threatened her enough to keep her quiet, though clearly not enough to quash her spirit. Any idea where they were taking you? She said not. Now don't be worried, I reassured her. Tell me, how old are you? She was sixteen. Oh, Jupiter. Married? Do I look like a person who's married? She looked like a person who soon should be. Papa, any plans? Perhaps he has his eye on some well-bred army officer, home from Syria or Spain? She seemed interested in the concept but shook her head. I could see one good reason for kidnapping this beauty. I improved on my trustworthy look. Any of Papa's friends been ogling you too keenly? Has your mother introduced you to any spruce young sons of her childhood friends? I haven't a mother, she interrupted calmly. There was a pause while I wondered at her odd way of putting it. Most people would say, my mother's dead or whatever. I worked out that her noble mamma was in excellent health, probably found in bed with a footman and divorced in disgrace. Excuse me, professional question. Any special admirer your family knows nothing about? Suddenly she burst into giggles. Oh, do stop being so silly. There's nobody like that. You're a very attractive young lady, I insisted, adding quickly, though of course you're safe with me. I see, she remarked. This time those huge brown eyes suddenly danced in high spirits. I realised with astonishment that I was being teased. Some of it was bluff. She'd been badly frightened and now she was trying to be a good girl. She wanted to be brave. The braver she was, the sweeter she looked. Her beautiful eyes were gazing into mine, brimming with mischief and causing serious troubles of their own. Just in time, footfalls dragged to a halt outside. Then my door was battered with that casual arrogance that could only mean a visit from the law.

=== CHAPTER 4: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 4 ===
 Chapter 4 The law settled his breathing rate after the stairs. "'Do come in,' I said mildly. "'It's not locked.' He was in. He collapsed at the other end of my bench. "'Have a seat,' I offered. "'Falco, you villain! Well, this is an improvement!' He gave me a slow grin. "'Petronius Longus, patrol captain of the Aventine watch. A big, placid, sleepy-looking man with a face people trusted. Probably because it gave so little away.' Petronius and I went back a long time. We joined the army on the same day, finding each other in the queue to take the oath to the emperor, and finding, too, that we'd been brought up only five streets apart. We were tentmates for seven years, and when we came home, we had another thing in common. We were veterans of the Second Augustine Legion in Britain. Not only that, we were veterans of the Second at the time of Queen Boudicca's revolt against Rome. So, because of the Second's abysmal performance, we both left the army eighteen years early, and we both had something we never wanted to talk about. "'Poke your eyes back in,' I told him. Her name's Helena.' "'Hello, Helena. What a pretty name.' "'Falco? Where did you find that?' Running a foot race round the Temple of Saturn. I'd chosen to answer him with such simple honesty, because there was a slim chance Petronius already knew. Besides, I wanted the girl to believe she was dealing with a man who told the truth. I introduced the watch-captain to my dazzling client. "'Petronius Longus, District Patrolman. The best.' "'Good evening, sir,' she said. I go forward bitterly. "'Take a job in local government. Women will call you sir. Sweetheart, there's no need to overdo it.' "'Take no notice of this tricky character,' Petronius scoffed in his easy way, smiling at her with an interest I did not altogether like. She smiled back at him. So I clipped tersely, "'We men want to gossip with a winejerk. Go into the bedroom and wait for me.' She shot me a look, but she went. "'That's the benefit of a liberal education. This little girl knew she lived in a man's world. Besides, she had pretty manners and it was my house.' "'Nice,' approved Petronius in a low voice. "'He has a wife who for some reason adores him. He never refers to her, but must care about her. He's the type who would. They have three daughters, and like a good Roman father, he's utterly sentimental about his girls. I could see a day coming when the two Lyannum jail would be crammed with frightful young sprogs who'd cast their beady eyes at Petro's girls. I produced two wine cups which looked clean, though I polished up Petro's on the hem of my tunic before I clonked them on the table. In the hole under a floorboard that passed for my wine cellar, I had some smoked Spanish poison that was a gift from a grateful client, some new dusky red that tasted as if it had been robbed from an Etruscan tomb, and a well-aged amphora of decent white cetinum. Since Petro's visit was so awkwardly timed, I wavered over acting casual and just serving the Etruscan. But in the end I settled for the cetinum because we were old friends. Anyway, I fancied some myself. As soon as he tasted it, he knew he was being bribed. He said nothing. We drained several cups. The time came when a chat seemed unavoidable. Listen, he broached, there's a hue and cry for a little gold hemmed skirt who was lifted from a senator's house this morning. Don't ask me why. Want me to keep an eye out, I suggested, perking up cheerily, though I could see he was not deceived. Eris, is she? Shut up, Falco. She was spotted later in the clutch of some slavering ghoul whose description uncannily fits yours. Her name is Sasha Camelina. She's strictly off limits, and I want to put back where she came from before we have some pretas pet helpers crawling all over my patch, passing rude remarks on the way I run the markets. That her in there. He nodded at the bedroom doorway. I owned up meekly. Imagine it must be. I liked him. He was good at his job. We both knew he'd found his lost kitten. I explained about her in a way that laid a great deal of emphasis on my gallant role as rescuer of frantic nobility and, in view of Petro's earlier remark, less on me wrecking market stalls. It seemed best not to place him in any awkward dilemmas. I'll have to take her back, Petro said. He was nicely drunk. I'll take her, I promised. Do me a favour. If you go, it's thanks for doing your duty, officer. For me, they may stretch to a small reward. Split. Lubricated by a good wine, my crony Petronius becomes a gentleman. Not many men are so considerate of the profit and loss columns of M. Didius Falco's personal accounts. Oh, he tipped his cup wryly. This'll do me. Give me your word. I gave him my word and the rest of the set in them. Then he went away happy. I had no real intention of giving her back. Well, not yet.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Character Identification & Aliases**
   Use advanced reasoning to identify when different names/titles refer to the same person
Examples: "Didius Falco" = "Falco", "the young prince" = "Prince Adrian" = "Adrian"
Merge all references into a single character entry using the most complete/formal name

2. **Physical Description Building**
   Extract ALL physical details mentioned about each character FROM HEAD TO TOE
CRITICAL: Always describe the complete person for full body portraits:
- HEAD/HAIR: Hair color, style, length, texture, any head coverings, hair accessories
- FACE: Eyes, nose, mouth, skin tone, facial hair, distinguishing features
- BODY: Build, height, posture, skin marks, tattoos, scars
- CLOTHING: Every layer from top to bottom, colors, materials, condition
- FEET/FOOTWEAR: ALWAYS include footwear details (boots, sandals, shoes, bare feet, etc.)
If feet/footwear not mentioned in text, note "footwear not specified" but suggest appropriate footwear for the character's status/setting
Note when new details are revealed (e.g., a birthmark mentioned for the first time in chapter 5)

3. **Character Evolution & Sub-Characteristics**
   Identify when a character's appearance changes significantly
Create sub-characteristics for major transformations:
* Age progression (young prince → middle-aged king → elderly ruler)
* Status changes affecting appearance (peasant → knight → lord)
* Physical changes (injuries, scars, weight changes, hair changes)
* Costume/role changes (disguises, different outfits for different scenes)
   
4. **Detailed Appearance Descriptions**
   Make descriptions vivid and specific FOR FULL BODY PORTRAITS
For baseDescription: Include chapter references and detailed analysis from head to toe
For imagePrompt: Create clean COMPLETE head-to-toe visual descriptions without chapter refs
CRITICAL for imagePrompt:
- Start with age, gender, overall build
- Describe head/hair in detail (color, style, length, accessories)
- Include all facial features
- Describe complete outfit from top to bottom
- ALWAYS end with footwear (even if you must infer appropriate footwear)
Example: "tall man, approximately 6'2", broad shoulders, athletic build" → "tall man, 6'2", broad shoulders, athletic build, short dark hair, brown eyes, weathered face with realistic wrinkles, black tunic, leather belt, dark trousers, worn leather boots"
The goal is a COMPLETE person that AI can generate as a full body portrait
IMPORTANT: Describe realistic human proportions and features, avoid exaggerated features

5. **Chapter Tracking**
   - For the main character entry: track all chapters where ANY version appears
   - For each sub-characteristic: track specific chapters where that version appears
   - This allows determining which version of a character is active in any given chapter
   - IMPORTANT: Include chapter numbers from ALL the chapters you just analyzed (2, 3, 4)
