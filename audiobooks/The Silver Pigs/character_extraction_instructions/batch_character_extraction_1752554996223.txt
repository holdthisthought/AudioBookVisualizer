=== CHAPTER 5: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 5 ===
 Chapter Five I whipped into the bedroom, dangerous with annoyance. The curtain zinged along its rod. The little lost person jumped up guiltily, spilling my private notebooks onto the floor. "'Give me those!' I roared. Now I was really furious. "'You're a poet!' She was stalling for time. "'Is Aglia the White Dove about a woman?' I suppose they're all about women. They're rather rude. "'I'm sorry, I was interested.' Aglia was a girl I knew, neither white nor the least bit like a dove. Come to that, Aglia was not her name. Bright eyes were still giving me that vulnerable look, but a rather worse effect. The loveliest women lose their gloss once you notice they're lying through their teeth. "'You're about to hear something considerably ruder,' I snapped. "'Sosha Kamelina?' So why the false travel pass?' "'I was frightened,' she protested. "'I didn't want to say my name. I didn't know what you wanted.' I let it pass. Neither did I. "'Who's Helena?' "'My cousin. She went to Britain. She got divorced. Extravagance or mere adultery?' She said it was too complicated to explain. "'Ah!' I cried bitterly. "'I'd never been married, but I was an expert in divorce. Adultery. I've heard of women being exiled to islands for immoral behaviour, but exile to Britain seems a bit bleak.' "'Sosha Kamelina' looked curious.' "'How can you tell?' "'I've been there. Because of the rebellion I sounded terse. She'd have been six years old at the time. She did not remember the Great British Revolt, and I was not starting history lessons now. Suddenly she demanded, "'Why did your friend call you a tricky character?' "'I'm a Republican. Petronius Longus thinks that's dangerous.' "'Why are you a Republican?' "'Because every free man should have a voice in the government of the city where he has to live. Because the Senate should not hand control of the Empire for life to one mortal, who may turn out insane or corrupt or immoral, and probably will. "'Because I hate to see Rome degenerate into a madhouse controlled by a handful of aristocrats manipulated by the cynical ex-slaves, while the mass of its citizens cannot earn a decent living.' Impossible to tell what she made of all that. Her next inquiry was stubbornly practical. "'Do private informers earn a decent living?' "'Taking every legal opportunity, they grab enough to keep alive. "'On good days,' I said, "'there may be Tucker on the table to give us the energy to rave at the injustice of the world.' I was well away now. I'd matched Petronius Leverley with a wine. "'Do you think the world is unjust?' "'I know it, lady.' Sasha stared at me gravely, as if she was saddened that the world had treated me so hard. I stared back. I was none too overjoyed myself. I felt tired. I went out into the living room, and after a moment the girl came, too.' "'I need to go to the lavatory again.' I was seized by the wild anxiety of a man who brings home a puppy because it looks so sweet, then realises that on the sixth floor he has problems. No need to panic. My apartment was Spartan, but my way of life hygienic. "'Well,' I teased, "'there are several alternatives. You can pop downstairs and try to persuade Linear to open up the laundry after hours, or you can run along the street to the big public convenience. But don't forget to take your copper to get in, because six flights is a long way to come back for it.' "'I suppose,' snapped Sasha haughtily, "'you and your men friends pee off the balcony.' I looked shocked. I was, mildly. "'Don't you know there are laws against that?' "'I had not imagined,' sneered Sasha, "'you would worry about the public nuisance laws.' She was getting the measure of the establishment I ran. She'd already got the measure of me.' I croaked my finger. She followed me back into the bedroom, where I introduced her to the arrangements which I modestly used myself. "'Thank you,' she said. "'Don't mention it. I returned.' I peed off the balcony just to prove my independence. This time when she came back I was brooding. I seemed to be struggling more than usual with the background to this kidnap. I could not decide whether I'd missed the point, or whether, in fact, I knew all there was to know. I wondered if the senator she belonged to was politically active. Sasha might have been snatched to influence his vote. Oh, God, surely not. She was far too beautiful. There must be more involved than that.' "'Are you taking me home?' "'Too late. Too risky. I'm too drunk.' I turned away, wandered across the bedroom, and collapsed onto my bed. She stood in the doorway like a leftover fishbone. "'Where am I going to sleep?' I was almost as drunk as Petronius. I was lying flat on my back, nursing my notebooks. I was incapable of anything more than feeble gestures and silliness. "'Against my heart, little goddess!' I exclaimed, then flung my arms wide, very carefully, one at a time. She was frightened. "'All right,' she retorted. She was a stalwart little piece. I grinned at her weakly, then flopped back into my previous position. I was pretty frightened myself. I was right, though. It was too great a risk to step out of doors with anyone so precious. Not after nightfall. Not in Rome. Not through those pitch-black streets full of burglars and buggery. She was safer with me.' "'Was she safe?' somebody asked me afterwards. I avoided answering. To this day, I don't know, really, whether Sasha Kamelina was safe with me that night or not.' "'To Sasha,' I said gruffly. Guests, take the reading couch. Blankets in the wooden box.' I watched her construct an elaborate cocoon. She made a terrible job of it. Like a tent full of legionary recruits. Eight lackadaisical lads wearing scratchy new tunics who'd never made up a camp bed before. She fidgeted round the couch for ages, tucking in far too many covers, far too tight. "'I need a pillow,' she complained finally in a small, serious voice, like a child who could only sleep if she followed a fixed nightly routine. I was blissful with wine and excitement. I did not care whether I had a pillow or not. I hooked one hand behind my head, then flung a mine. Wide, but she caught it. Sasha Kamelina inspected my pillow as though it might harbour fleas. Another charge of resentment against the nobility. Possibly it did, but any wildlife was tightly sewn inside a cheerful red and purple cover inflicted on me by my mamma. I did not care to have snooty chits of girls casting aspersions on my household goods. It's perfectly clean. Use it and be grateful.' She laid the pillow very neatly at the end of her bed. I blew out the light. Private informers can be gentlemen, when they're too drunk for anything else. I slept like a babe. I've no idea whether my visitor did the same. Probably not.

=== CHAPTER 6: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 6 ===
 CHAPTER VI The Senator Decimus Camillus Verus lived in the Capana Gate sector. The Capana Gate was the district next but one to mine, so I walked. On the way I passed my youngest sister, Maya, and at least two little roughnecks off our family tree. Some informers give the impression we're solitary men. Perhaps that was where I went wrong. Every time I was surreptitiously trailing some adulterous clerk in a shiny tunic, I looked out to find one of these midgets wiping his nose on his arm and bawling my name across the street. I was a hobbled donkey in Rome. I must have been related to most people between the Tiber and the Ardiatine Gate. I had five sisters, the poor girl my brother Festus never found the time to marry, thirteen nephews and four nieces, with several more visibly on the way. That excludes what lawyers call my heirs of the fourth and fifth degree, my mother's brothers and my father's sisters and all the second cousins of the first marriage children of the stepfathers of my grandfather's aunts. I had a mother too, though I tried to ignore that. I waved back at the roughnecks. I keep them sweet. One or two of them are. Anyway, I used these artful urchins to trail the adulterers when I slope off to the races instead. Decimus Camillus owned a freehold mansion on his own square of land among quiet domestic streets. He purchased the right to draw water direct from the old Appian aqueduct nearby. He felt no financial necessity to lease his frontage out as shops, nor his upper storey as lodging rooms, though he did share his desirable plot with the owner of an identical house next door, from which I deduced that this senator was by no means extravagantly rich. Like the rest of us, the poor muffin was struggling to keep up the way of life appropriate to his rank, the difference between him and most of us being that to qualify for the Senate, Decimus Camillus Verus must be a millionaire. Since I was visiting a million sesterces, I risked my throat under a barber's razor. I wore a worn white toga with the holes folded out of sight, a short clean tunic, my best belt with a Celtic buckle and brown boots. A free citizen, his importance signaled by the length of his train of slaves. In my case, none. There were spanking new escutcheon plates on the senator's door locks, but a hanged dog porter with a badly bruised cheekbone looked through his grill and opened up as soon as I pulled at the rope on the big copper bell. They were expecting someone, probably the same someone who socked the porter yesterday and carried off the girl. We crossed a black and white tiled hall with a spluttery fountain and faded cinnabar paint. Camillus was a diffident man in his fifties who lurked in a library among a mass of paperwork, a bust of the emperor and one or two decent bronze lamps. He looked normal, but he wasn't. But one thing, he was polite. Good morning. How can I help you? The name's Didius Falco. Credential, sir. I bowled him one of Sasha's bracelets. It was British jet, the stuff they shipped down from the northeast coast, carved in interlocking pieces like whale's teeth. She told me her cousin sent it. I knew the style from my army days, but they were rare in Rome. He inspected it gently. May I ask where you obtained this? Off the arm of a decorative party I rescued yesterday from two thieving hulks. Is she hurt? No, sir. He had heavy eyebrows above decently spaced eyes that looked at me directly. His hair bristled straight up from his head, even though it was not particularly short, giving him a cheerful, boyish look. I saw him brace himself to ask what I wanted. I put on my helpful face. Senator, would you like me to bring her back? What are your terms? Any idea who took her, sir? None. If I'd realized he was lying, I should have admired the brisk way the man spoke. As it was, I liked his insistence. Your terms, please? Just professional curiosity. I've tucked her away somewhere safe. I'm a private informer. A watch captain called Petronius Longus in the 13th will vouch for me. He reached for his ink pot and made some notes across the corner of a letter he'd been reading. I liked that, too. He intended to check. I suggested without pressure that if he was grateful, he might hire me to help. He looked thoughtful. I outlined my rates, adding something for his rank since it would all take slightly longer if I had to keep calling him sir. He showed some reluctance, which I reckon was because he did not want me hanging around the girl, but eventually we agreed I would advise him on household security and keep an ear to the ground about the kidnappers. You might be right about keeping Sasha Kamelina out of sight, he said. Is your hideout respectable? Supervised by my own mother, sir. True. She scoured my rooms regularly for evidence of loose women. Sometimes she found it, sometimes I hustled them out in time. This senator was no idiot. He decided someone had to come back with me to make sure the wench was safe. I advised him against that. I'd seen some greasy meat boards in the cook shop opposite watching visitors to his home. There was nothing to say they were connected with Sasha. They could have been casual burglars who'd picked an unlucky day to size up a future break-in. Since he was walking me round his property anyway, we went to look. On the front door they had a sound wooden lock with a six-inch three-toothed iron rotary key, plus four brass bolts, an inspection grill with a natty little slider, and a great home oak beam inside to sling across on two well-bedded cradles at night. The door porter lived in a cubbyhole at the side. "'Addoquate,' remarked the senator. I gave him a long look, including the dozy sprite they used as a doorman, the slack-mouthed strip of wind who'd let Sasha's adductors walk in. "'Oh, yes, sir. A wonderful system. So let me offer you some advice.' "'Use it.' I could see he took the point. I made him peer through the grill to inspect the two loafers in the cook shop. "'Those people saw me come in. I'll hop out over your back wall. Give me a chance to survey the rear of the house. Send a slave to the local lock-up and get them arrested for causing a breach of the peace.' "'But they are not.' "'They will be,' I told him, when the preta's posse starts arresting them.' He was persuaded. The leaders of the empire are so easily led. The senator spoke to his doorman, who looked annoyed but ambled off on the errand. "'I made Camillus Verus show me his upstairs accommodation. Then when we came down ten minutes later, I looked out again and saw the two loafers from the cook shop with their arms up their backs being marched off down the street by a brisk group of soldiers. Reassuring to discover that when a citizen of substance complains to a magistrate, the response is so prompt. "'With all that cast ironwork on the front door, at the back they had seven different entrances to the garden with nary a decent lock among them. The kitchen door opened when I tried my own home latch-lifter. None of the windows had bars. A balcony around the upper storey offered access to the entire house. Their elegant smoky-blue dining room possessed flimsy folding doors, which I forced with an edging tile from a flower bed while the senator's secretary watched. He was a thin Greek slave with a hook nose and the air of superiority with which Greek secretaries are embalmed at birth. I dictated instructions at length. I decided I enjoyed dictating. I also enjoyed the look on the Greek's face when I grinned goodbye, clambered onto a sundial, found a toe-hold on a knot of ivy, and hoisted myself up the sheer dividing wall to see about the house next door. Who lives there? The master's younger brother. As a younger brother myself, I noted with pleasure that Camillus, Jr. had sense. He'd fixed up every window with solid slatted shutters, all painted in dark malachite green. Both houses had been faced in standard lava blocks, with their upper floors supported on skinny pillars hewn from a wall. The architect had been lavished with his shaped terracotta gable ends, but by the time he came to stock the grounds with the customary statues of graceful nymphs in their underwear, his contingency funds ran out. The gardens were furnished with meager sticks of trellis, though their plants burgeoned with health. It was the same building contract on both sides of the wall. Hard to say why the senator's house bore an approachable, easy-going smile while his brothers felt formal and cold. I was glad Sasha lived in the house with a smile. I gazed at the brother's house for a long time, not quite sure what I was looking for. Then, with a wave to the Greek, I walked along the top of the divider to the far end. I jumped nonchalantly off. I got covered in dust and twisted my knee, landing in the alley behind the senator's garden wall. Hercules knows why I did it. There was an entry for delivery carts with a perfectly good gate,

=== CHAPTER 7: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 7 ===
 Chapter Seven As I walked towards home, the streets became more clamorous, with traders' cries, hoofbeats, and harness bells. A small black dog, his fur clinging in spiked clumps, barked madly at me as I passed the baker's shop. When I turned back to swear at him, my head bonked against a sequence of jugs that had been hung on a rope by a potter, whose idea of advertisement was to show his work could take a bashing. Luckily, my head was also strong. In the Ostia road, I was buffeted by bodkin sellers and footmen in crimson livery, but I managed to get my own back by squashing the toes of several slaves. Three streets from home, I glimpsed my mother buying artichokes with a pursed-lipped look that means she's thinking about me. I ducked behind some barrels of winkles and then backtracked to avoid finding out whether this was true. She did not appear to have seen me. Things were going well. Friends with a senator, open-ended contract, and best of all, Sasha. I was brought up sharp from this reverie by two bully boys whose greetings made me grunt with pain. Whoops! cried I. Look, lads, it's all been a mistake. Tell Smiractus my rents with his accountant. I failed to recognize either, but Smiractus rarely keeps his gladiators long. If they can't run away, they inevitably die in the ring. If they don't make it that far, they perish from starvation, since Smiractus' idea of a training diet is a handful of pale yellow lentils in lashings of old bathwater. I assumed these were my landlord's latest bruises from the gym. My assumption was awry. By now my head was being gripped under the first bully boy's elbow. The second put his face down to grin at me. I had a sideways view of the cheek guards of the latest design of helmet and a familiar scarlet neckerchief under his chin. These beggars were army. I considered coming the old soldier, but in view of my legion's record, a dropout from the second Augusta was unlikely to impress. Guilty conscience, cried the sideways face. Something else to worry you. Didius Falco, you're under arrest. Arrest by the boys in red felt familiar, like being tickled for cash by Smiractus. The biggest of these two big lads was attempting to squeeze out my tonsils with the racy efficiency of a cook's boy podding peas with his thumb. I would have asked him to stop, but I was specious with admiration for his technique.

=== CHAPTER 8: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 8 ===
 Chapter 8 A social at home in a guard post, courtesy of an idyllé called Attius Pertinax. I was expecting to be hauled off to prison, the Laotumiiae, or even the Mamatine, if my luck had completely run out. Instead, they trooped me all the way back east into the First. This startled me, since until that morning I'd never done business in the Capana Gate sector. I was astonished that I'd offended the authorities in quite so short a time. If there's one class of person I hate above all others, it's the idyllés. For the benefit of provincials, let me say that in Rome the praetors govern law and order, senior senators, elected six at a time, who divide the fourteen districts between them. Each has a junior to do all the legwork. These idyllés, brash young politicians in their first public posts, filling time before the better jobs that bring in bigger bribes. Gnaeus Attius Pertinax was typical of the breed, a short-haired pup yapping up the political ladder, nagging butchers to sweep clean their shop fronts, and beating the hell out of me. I'd never seen him before. In retrospect, I remember no more than a washed-out grey streak, half hidden by a shaft of dazzling sunlight. The greyness maybe lost recollection. I think he had light eyes and a stiff nose. He was in his late twenties, just younger than me, his tight nature reflected in a constipated face. There was an older man, no purple on his clothes, not a senator, who sat on the sidelines and said nothing. A bland, unremarkable face, and a bald, unremarkable head. In my experience, men who sit in corners are the ones to watch. But first, pleasantries with Pertinax. Tharco, he commanded, after brisk preliminaries, established who I was. Where's the girl? I had a serious grudge against Attius Pertinax, though I did not know it yet. I was wondering how to answer in a way that would be rude enough, when he ordered his sergeant to encourage me. I pointed out I was a free-born citizen, and that laying a fist on a citizen was an affront to democracy. It turned out neither Pertinax nor the Bully Boys were students of political science. They said about affronting democracy without a qualm. I had the right of appeal, directly to the emperor, but I decided there was not much future in that. If I thought Pertinax was being so violent out of affection for Sasha, it might have been easier to bear. But we shared no fellow feeling. The whole event troubled me. A senator might well have second thoughts, cancel our contract, and report me to the magistrate. Yet Decimus Camillus had looked a soft touch, and he knew, more or less, where his missing miss was. So I braved it out, bruised but proud. I shall return Sasha Camillina to her family when they ask me. And do your worst, Pertinax. I shall return her to no one else. I saw his eyes travel to the middle rancor in the corner. The man had a lean, sad, tolerant smile. Thank you, this one said. My name is Publius Camillus Mato. I am her father. Perhaps I can ask you now. I closed my eyes. It was quite true. Nobody actually told me the senator's relationship to Sasha. This must be his younger brother, the man who lived in the frosty house next door. So my client was only her uncle. All the rights of ownership would lie with her papa. In response to further questioning, as they say, I agreed to take her father and his pleasant friends to Fetcher. Back at the laundry, Lenia popped out, intrigued by the uncoordinated tramping of large numbers of feet. Seeing me under arrest caused no surprise. Felco, your mother said— Oh! Out of the way, you filthy old bladder! shouted the idyllic Pertinax, flinging it to one side. To spare him the indignity of being fruit-pressed to a pulp by a woman, I interceded gently— Not the time, Lenia. After twenty years of wringing out heavily wet togas, she possessed deceptive strength. He could have been badly damaged. I wish that he had been. I wish I'd held him down for Lenia while she did it. I wish I'd damaged him myself. But then the momentum of our arrival had carried us up the stairs. Their visit was brief. When we all burst into my apartment, Sasha Kamelina was not there.

 Chapter Nine Pertinax was furious. I felt depressed. Her father looked weary. I offered to help him find her. I saw him snap. "'Stay away from my daughter, Falco!' he cried angrily. Understandable. He could probably guess my interest. Keeping layabouts away from a daughter like that must occupy a lot of his time. I murmured in a responsible tone. So I'm off the case.' "'You were never on it, Falco!' the idyll lay Pertinax crowed. I knew better than to argue with a touchy politician, especially one with such a pained face and pointy nose. Pertinax led his men rummage through my apartment for evidence. They found nothing. Even the sardine plates had been washed, though not by me. Before they left, they rearranged my furniture into handy cordwood sticks, and when I protested, one of them smashed me in the face so hard he all but broke my nose. If Attius Pertinax wanted me to think him a frousty lout with the habits of a gutter rat, he was half way home. As soon as they'd gone, Linnia rushed upstairs to see whether she could inform Smaractus that one of his tenants had expired. My wrecked belongings stopped her short. "'Juno! Your room! And your face, Falco!' The room was nothing special, but I'd once been proud of my face. I needed a new table,' I groaned wittily. "'You can buy wonderful ones nowadays. Decent slice of maple six feet across, bolted on a simple marble stand, just right with my bronze candelabrum.' I used to light my room with a tallow-dipped rush. "'Fool! Your mother says—' "'Spare me,' I said. "'Suit yourself!' She flounced off with her, I'm just the baggage who takes the message's face. Things were not going well. Still, my brain was not completely pulverized. I was too keen on good health to ignore a message from my ma. No need to trouble Linnia. I knew what it would be, and regarding my lost moppet with the malefluous brown eyes, I did have an idea where she was. News travels fast in the Aventine. Petronius turned up, fussing and none too pleased, while I was still exclaiming in agony as I bathed my face. "'Falco! Keep your filthy-mannered civic friends off my patch!' he whistled. Then at once took the black pottery jug from my shaking hand and poured for me himself. It was like old times, after bad nights brawling outside the centurion's dining club in Isca Dumnon-Niorum. At 29, it hurt much more than when we were 19. After a while he propped up what remained of my bench on two bricks from my stove, then sat me down. "'Who did this to you, Falco?' I managed to tell him, using only the left half of my mouth. "'An overexcited idile called Atius Pertinax. I'd like to open him out like a spatchcock chicken, completely boned on a very hot grill.' Petronius growled. "'He hates idiles even more than I do. They get in his way, they upset local loyalties, they take all the credit, then leave him to tidy up their mess.' He prized up my loose floorboard and brought me some wine, but it stung me too much, so he drank it himself. We both hate waste.' "'You all right?' I nodded and let him do the talking. "'I've been checking on the Camillus family. The senator's daughter is away on travel leave. There are two sons, one doing his year in the army in Germany, one bashing a desk, wiping the governor's nose in Bitic and Spain. Your little girlfriend is some hushed up indiscretion of the senator's brother. He's not married. Don't ask me how he gets away with that.' According to the censor's office, Sosia was recorded as the child of one of his slaves, acknowledged, then adopted by him. Could just be her father is a decent type. Or could be a mother was someone more important than he can say.' "'Meet him,' I squeezed out like a sour pip. Bit thin-lipped. Why not in the Senate, too?' "'Usual story. Family could only buy in the political votes once. Elder son was put into purple stripes. Younger foisted into commerce instead. Lucky old commerce.' "'Is it true that you've lost her?' I tried to grin. What a failure.' Petro winced. "'She's not lost. Come with me, Petro. If she's where I think, I need your support.' Sosia Camelina was where I thought.'

=== CHAPTER 10: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 10 ===
 Chapter 10. Petro and I ducked down a tiled entry between a cutler's and a cheese shop. We took the stairs before the elegant ground-floor apartment that was occupied by the idle ex-slave who owned the whole block, and several other blocks, too. They know how to live. We were in a flaky gray building behind the emporium, not far from the river, but not so near that it flooded in the spring. It was a poor neighborhood, but there were green creepers wound round all the pillars on the street side, sleep-cats asleep in window-boxes, summer bulbs brightening the balconies. Someone always kept a step swept here. It seemed to me a friendly sort of place, but I'd known it a long time. On the first floor landing we banged at a brick-red door, which I had under pressure painted myself, and were admitted by a tiny waif of a slave. We found our own way to the room where I knew everyone would be. Ha! Wine shops all closed early! Hello, mother, I said. My mother was in her kitchen supervising her cook, which meant the cook was nowhere in sight, but Ma was doing something rapid to a vegetable with a sharp knife. She works on the principle that if you want anything done properly, do it yourself. All around her were other people's children, with their steely jaws clamped into loaves and fruit. When we arrived, Sasha Kamelina sat at the kitchen table gorging a piece of cinnamon cake with a gusto that told me she was already well at home, as people in my parents' house tend to be. Where was my father? Best not to inquire. He went out to a game of drafts when I was seven. Must be a long game, because he still hasn't come home. I kissed my mother's cheek like a dutiful son, hoping Sasha would notice, and was whacked with a colander from a trouble. Ma greeted Petronius with an affectionate smile. Such a good boy, such a hard-working wife, such a regular well-paid job. My older sister Victorina was there. Petronius and I both withdrew into ourselves. I was terrified Victorina would call me trouble in front of Sasha. I could not imagine why he looked so worried. Hello, trouble, said my sister. Then to Petronius. Hello, Primrose. She was married now to a plasterer, but in some ways she'd not changed since she'd tyrannised the thirteenth when we were small. Petronius had not known the rest of us in those days, but like everyone for miles around, he knew of our Victorina. How's my favourite nephew? I asked, since she was holding her latest pug-faced progeny. He had the wrinkled face and tearful gaze of a hundred-year-old man. He stared at me over a shoulder with visible contempt, barely crawling yet, but he could recognise a fraud. Victorina shot me a tired look. She knew my heart belonged to Marcia, our three-year-old niece. My mother sedated Petronius with a casket of raisins, while she extracted impertinent facts about his relations with his wife. I managed to get hold of a melon slice, but Victorina's infant seized the other end. He had the grip of a Libernian wrestler. We struggled for some minutes, then I gave way to the better chap. The wretch hurled the melon onto the floor. Sasha watched everything with immense solemn eyes. I suppose she'd never been anywhere where there was so much going on in such good-humoured chaos. Hello, Falka. Hello, Sasha. I smiled in tones that were meant to lap her body in liquid gold. My sister and mother exchanged a derisory glance. I put one foot on the bench beside Sasha and gazed down with a simmering leer until my mother noticed. Get your boot off my bench! I took my boot off the bench. Little goddess, you and I need a private talk. Whatever you need, my informed me, can be discussed right here. Grinning more than I thought necessary, Petronius Longest sat down at the table and leaned his chin on his hands while he waited for me to begin. Everyone knew that I had no idea what I wanted to say. On several occasions before that, indignant females had described to me the expression on my mother's face when she met some painted madam with a scented skirt in my rooms. Sometimes I never saw them again. In fairness to my mother, my conquests had included bad mistakes. What's going on here? My mother had rapped at Sasha when she discovered her during my enforced chat with Pertinax. Good morning, responded Sasha. My mother sniffed. She strode to the bedroom, flung aside the curtain and weighed up the situation with a camp bed. Well, I can see what's going on. Client? I'm not allowed to say, Sasha said. My mother replied that she would be the judge of what was allowed. Then she sat Sasha down and gave her something to eat. She has her methods. Pretty soon she'd wormed out the whole tale. She demanded what Sasha's noble mama would think, so Sasha unwisely mentioned having no noble mama. My own sweet parent was appalled. Right, you can come with me. Sasha murmured that she felt safe enough. My mother gave her a sharp look. Sasha went with my mama. Now Petronius, bless him, weighed in to help me out. Time we took you home, little lady. I told Sasha how the senator had engaged me, from which she assumed rather too much. So he explained. I thought Uncle Decimus was being overcautious at first. She stopped, then rounded on me accusingly. You don't know what I'm talking about. Tell me then, I said very gently. She was deeply troubled. Her great eyes flew towards my mother. People always trust my mother. I don't know what to do, she pleaded. My mother answered huffily. Don't look at me. I never interfere. I snorted at this. Marr ignored it, but even Petro'd let Slipper Stifel get fore of amusement. Oh, tell him about your bank box, child. The worst he can do is steal it, mother said. Such wonderful faith. I suppose you can't blame her. My older brother Festus, for some peculiar reason, made himself a military hero. I can't compete with that. Uncle Decimus is hiding something very important in my bank box in the Forum, Sasha muttered guiltily. I'm the only person who knows the number to open the box. Those men were taking me there. I stared at her with a set face, making her suffer. In the end I turned man to man to Petronius. What do you think? I had no doubt of his answer. Stroll along and look. Sasha Kamelina was behaving very meekly, but she did pipe up to warn us we should need to take a handcart to carry the loot.

=== CHAPTER 11: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 11 ===
 Chapter 11 The forum was cooler and quieter than when I was here with Sasha before, especially in the long colonnade where money-changers offered safe deposits for nervous citizens. The Camillus family banked with a grinning Bithynian who'd invested unhealthily in excess body fat. Sasha whispered a number to identify her property. Happy Face unlocked her box. It was a large box, although what was inside turned out to be comparatively small. The box lid fell back. Sasha Camillina stood to one side. When Petra and I peered in, her savings were even less impressive than mine. Her uncle hired her this strong box as her sensible discipline, but she owned no more than ten gold coins and a few decent pieces of jewellery that her aunt thought she was too young yet to wear. It was a point of view. She was old enough for me. Our object of inquiry was folded up in felt and roped around with hemp. Since the banker was watching us with frank Bithynian curiosity, Petronius gave me a hand to drag it out unwrapped. It seemed impossibly heavy. It was like we'd borrowed a handcart from my brother-in-law the plasterer, who was out of work as usual. My brother-in-law was not out of work because all the walls in Rome were sound and smooth. It was because people in Rome would rather look at bare slats than employ a boss-eyed, bone-idle swine like him. We staggered off with our trolley creaking under the weight. Petro let me do most of the work. "'Don't hurt yourself,' Sasha had the grace to exclaim. Petronius winked at her. "'Not as puny as he looks. Does secret weight training in a gladiator's gym. Use your muscles, Blossom.' "'You must tell me sometime,' I gasped in retaliation, "'why my sister Victorina calls you Primrose.' He said nothing, but he blushed. I swear he did. Fortunately, Rome is a sophisticated city. Two men with a girl and a handcart can crawl into a wine shop without causing comment. We moved down a shady side street and plunged indoors. I bagged a table in a dark corner while Petro laid on some hot pies. It took both of us to raise the precious object up onto the table with a thud. Cautiously we peeled back the felt. "'Shades of Hades,' Petronius let out. "'I could see why Uncle Decimus did not want this new baby announced in the Daily Gazette.' Sasha Kamelina had no idea what it was. Petro and I knew. Both of us felt slightly sick. Petro, with his iron stomach, nevertheless leaned back on his joint-stool and snapped his teeth into a vegetable pie. Rather than surrender to unhappy memories, I bit into one too. Mine was basically rabbit with chicken livers and, I think, juniper. Not bad. There was a plate of pork, titbits. We let Sasha chew on those.' "'That lonely hole of a customs post,' Petro reminisced in horror, stuck on the Sabrina estuary the wrong side of the frontier. Nothing to do but count the coracles floating in the mist and keep one eye open in case the dark little men came over the river on a raid. Oh dear gods, Falco, remember the rain.' I remembered the rain. The long drear rain in southwest Britain is unforgettable. "'Falco, whatever is it?' Sasha hissed. I said, relishing the drama. Sasha Kamelina, this is a silver pig.'

=== CHAPTER 12: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 12 ===
 Chapter 12 It was an ingot of lead. It weighed two hundred Roman pounds. I tried to explain once to a woman I knew how heavy that was. Not a lot heavier than you. You're a tall girl, quite a solid piece. A bridegroom could just about heave you over his threshold and not lose his silly smile. The winch I was insulting happened to be a substantial armful, though by no means overweight. It sounds unkind, but if you've ever tried picking up a well-fed young lady, you'll appreciate the comparison was fairly exact. In fact, lifting this dense grey slab before we knew what we were doing had left two of us with bad backs. Petronius and I gazed at the silver pig like an old and not entirely convenient friend. Whatever is it? Sasha demanded. I told her. Why do you call them pigs? I explained that when pressure saw is being refined, molten metal runs away from the furnaces into a long channel where moulds for the ingots lead off down each side, like sucking piglets beside their mother sow. Petronius stared at me sceptically while I said this. Sometimes Petro seems amazed by the things I claim to know. This valuable porker was a long, dull block of metal, about 20 inches long by five wide and four deep, slightly bevelled at the sides, with the emperor's name and the date on one long edge. It looked nothing, but a man who tried to carry it would soon find himself bent double. 24 ladles of molten ore to each standard mould, not quite too heavy to handle, but difficult to steal. Worth it though, if you could. The silver yield from Mendip's ore is remarkably high, on average 130 ounces to the tonne. I wondered whether the silver had already been extracted from the bauble on the table. The government claims a monopoly of precious ore. Wherever it came from, this belonged in the mint. We rolled it over and banged it topside up, looking for an official stamp. It was stamped all right. T-C-L-T-R-I-F. Some new piece of nonsense. Not once, but four times, then. E-X-A-R-G-B-R-I-T. The old familiar mark we half hoped and half dreaded to find. Petronius groaned. Britain, a perfect signature. Someone must be sweating. An uncomfortable feeling struck us both at the same time. Better move, Petro suggested. Shall I tidy this away? Our usual place? You take the girl? I nodded. Falco, what's happening? Sasha demanded excitedly. He's putting the silver pig somewhere smelly, where felons shall be too sensitive to look, I said. You're going home. And I need an urgent chat with your uncle Decimus.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Character Identification & Aliases**
   Use advanced reasoning to identify when different names/titles refer to the same person
Examples: "Didius Falco" = "Falco", "the young prince" = "Prince Adrian" = "Adrian"
Merge all references into a single character entry using the most complete/formal name

2. **Physical Description Building**
   Extract ALL physical details mentioned about each character FROM HEAD TO TOE
CRITICAL: Always describe the complete person for full body portraits:
- HEAD/HAIR: Hair color, style, length, texture, any head coverings, hair accessories
- FACE: Eyes, nose, mouth, skin tone, facial hair, distinguishing features
- BODY: Build, height, posture, skin marks, tattoos, scars
- CLOTHING: Every layer from top to bottom, colors, materials, condition
- FEET/FOOTWEAR: ALWAYS include footwear details (boots, sandals, shoes, bare feet, etc.)
If feet/footwear not mentioned in text, note "footwear not specified" but suggest appropriate footwear for the character's status/setting
Note when new details are revealed (e.g., a birthmark mentioned for the first time in chapter 5)

3. **Character Evolution & Sub-Characteristics**
   Identify when a character's appearance changes significantly
Create sub-characteristics for major transformations:
* Age progression (young prince → middle-aged king → elderly ruler)
* Status changes affecting appearance (peasant → knight → lord)
* Physical changes (injuries, scars, weight changes, hair changes)
* Costume/role changes (disguises, different outfits for different scenes)
   
4. **Detailed Appearance Descriptions**
   Make descriptions vivid and specific FOR FULL BODY PORTRAITS
For baseDescription: Include chapter references and detailed analysis from head to toe
For imagePrompt: Create clean COMPLETE head-to-toe visual descriptions without chapter refs
CRITICAL for imagePrompt:
- Start with age, gender, overall build
- Describe head/hair in detail (color, style, length, accessories)
- Include all facial features
- Describe complete outfit from top to bottom
- ALWAYS end with footwear (even if you must infer appropriate footwear)
Example: "tall man, approximately 6'2", broad shoulders, athletic build" → "tall man, 6'2", broad shoulders, athletic build, short dark hair, brown eyes, weathered face with realistic wrinkles, black tunic, leather belt, dark trousers, worn leather boots"
The goal is a COMPLETE person that AI can generate as a full body portrait
IMPORTANT: Describe realistic human proportions and features, avoid exaggerated features

5. **Chapter Tracking**
   - For the main character entry: track all chapters where ANY version appears
   - For each sub-characteristic: track specific chapters where that version appears
   - This allows determining which version of a character is active in any given chapter
   - IMPORTANT: Include chapter numbers from ALL the chapters you just analyzed (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
