=== CHAPTER 13: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 13 ===
 Chapter 13 I took Sasha Kamelina home in a sedan chair. There was room for two. She was a diminutive scrap, and I could so rarely afford enough to eat that the bearers let us both ride. I stayed silent for a long time, so once she worked out I was no longer disgruntled with her, she chattered. I listened without listening. She was too young to sit in peace after a surprise. I was beginning to be annoyed with the entire Kamelis family. Nothing any of them ever said was true or complete unless it turned into something I preferred not to hear. My open-ended contract had led me down a cul-de-sac. Why are you so quiet? Sasha demanded suddenly. Are you wishing you could steal the silver pig? I said nothing. Naturally, I was wondering how that might be arranged. Do you ever have any money, Falco? Sometimes. What do you do with it? I told her I paid the rent. I see, she commented gravely. She was looking up at me with those great unsettling eyes. Her expression saddened into melting reproach for my aggressiveness. I wanted to suggest it was a bad idea to turn a look like that on men with whom she found herself alone, though I said nothing because I foresaw difficulties explaining why. Didius Falco, what do you really do with it? I send it to my mother. My tone of voice left her unsure whether I meant it, which was how I liked a woman to be left. At that time, I thought a man should never tell women what he does with his money. Those days were the days, of course, before I was married and had this issue placed in true perspective by my wife. What I really did with my money in those days was that sometimes I paid the rent. More often, not. Then, after deducting unavoidable expenses, I sent half to Mamar. I gave the rest to the young woman my brother never found the time to marry before he was killed in Judea, and the child he never even discovered he had. None of that was any business of a senator's niece. I dumped the girl on her relieved aunt. Senators' wives, in my scheme, fall into three types. The ones who sleep with senators, but not the senators who married them, the ones who sleep with gladiators, and a few who stay at home. Before Vespasian, the first two types were everywhere. There were even more afterwards, because when Vespasian became emperor, while he and his wife were married, he was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. She glanced first at Sasha, then her shrewd black eyes flicked over me. She was just the sort of sensible matron a bachelor would be lucky to find when he was presented with an illegitimate child he felt unable to ignore. I could see why the nifty Publius parked his Sasha here. Julia Justa, the senator's wife, took back her lost niece without fuss. She would ask her questions later, once the household settled down. Just the sort of decent, deserving woman who has the unhappy luck to be married to a man who dabbles in illegal currency, a man so inept he hires his own informer to expose him. I made my way to the library and marched in on Decimus unannounced. Surprise! A senator who collects not grubby Greek antiques, but ingots engraved artistically in the by the government. You're in enough trouble, sir. Why hire me as well? He had a shifty expression for a moment. Then he seemed to straighten up. I suppose a politician gets used to people calling him a liar. Dangerous ground, Falco. When you calm down—I was perfectly calm, furious, but lucid as glass. Senator, the silver pig must be stolen. I don't rate you as a thief. For one thing, I sneered, if you'd gone to the trouble of stealing British silver, you'd take much more care of your loot. What's your involvement? Official, he said, then had second thoughts. That was just as well, since I didn't believe him. Semi-official. I still didn't believe him. I choked back a laugh. And semi-corrupt. He brushed my bluntness aside. Falco, this has to be in confidence. The stale crust of his family's confidence was the last thing I welcomed. The ingot was found after a scuffle in the street and handed in to the magistrate's office. I know the preta for this sector. He's the man I dine with and his nephew gave a posting to my son. We discussed the ingot, naturally. Ah, just among friends. Whatever he'd done, to a man of his station, I was being unacceptably rude. His patience surprised me. I watched him closely. He was just as intently observing me. I would suspect he wanted a favor, had he been a different class of man. My daughter Helena took a letter to Britain. We have relatives there. My brother-in-law is the British Secretary of Finance. I wrote to him. All in the family, I see, I scoffed again. I've forgotten how clannish these people can be. Little pockets of reliable friends sewn into every province from Palestine to the pillars of Hercules. Falco, please. Gaius, my brother-in-law, conducted a skeleton audit. He discovered there'd been a steady wastage from the British minds at least since the year of the four emperors. Theft on a grand scale, Falco. Once we heard that, we wanted our evidence secure. My friend the preta asked my help. Using Sasha Kemalina's bank box was, I regret to say, my own bright idea. I told him our new hideout. He looked ill. Petro had taken the silver pig to Lenia's laundry. We would be banking it in her vat of bleaching pee. The senator made no comment on either our snaffling his exhibit or its pungent hiding place. What he offered me was much more dangerous. Are you busy at the moment? I was never busy. As an informer, I was not that good. Look, Falco, are you interested in helping us? We can't trust the official machine. Someone must already have talked. What about here? I interrupted. I never mentioned the ingot here. I took Sasha to bank it without telling her why, then forbade her to talk. He paused. She's a good child. I gestured wry acknowledgement. Falco, I admit we were careless before we grasped the implications. But if the preta's organization leaks, we can't take further risks. Your face seems to fit this job. Semi-official and semi-corrupt. Sarcastic old beggar. I realized the man had a quietly wicked streak. He was shrewder than he liked to appear. He certainly knew what preoccupied me. He ran one hand over that upright bush of hair, then said awkwardly, I had a meeting today at the palace. I can't say more than that, but with the empire to reconstruct after Nero and the Civil War, those ingots are sorely needed by the treasury. In our talks, your name came up. I understand you had a brother. My face really set. Excuse me, he exclaimed abruptly in that concerned way the occasional aristocrat has, which I never entirely trust. It was an apology, one I ignored. I'd not have these people discussing my brother. Well, would you want the job? My principal will honor your usual rates. I gather you inflated them for me. If you find the missing silver, you can expect a substantial bonus. I'd like to meet your principal, I snapped. My idea of a bonus may not be the same as his. Decimus Camillus snapped straight back. My principal's idea of a bonus is the best you will get. I knew it meant working for some snooty secretariat of jumped-up scribes who would slash my expenses, given I have a chance, but I took the job. I must have been mad. Still, he was Sasha's uncle, and I felt sorry for his wife. There was something odd about this case. By the way, sir, did you set a slick lynx called Attius Pertinax on my tail? He looked annoyed. No. Has he ties with your family? No, he chipped in impatiently, then checked. Nothing was simple here. A slight connection, he corrected himself, and by now his expression had deliberately cleared. Business links with my brother. Did you tell your brother that Sasha was with me? I had no opportunity. Someone did. He asked Pertinax to arrest me. The senator smiled. I do apologize. My brother has been frantically worried about his daughter. He'll be delighted you brought her home. Tidily cleared up. Petronius Longus had said my description was known, so an idyll might track me down. Pertinax and Publius assumed I was a villain. Big Brother Decimus had admitted to mention to little brother Publius the fact that he'd hired me. I was not surprised. I come from a large family myself. There were lots of things festers had never remembered to tell me.

=== CHAPTER 14: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 14 ===
 Chapter 14 This silver leak was a clever scheme. The British mines, which in my day were guarded so cautiously by the army, had apparently been tapped off as neatly as those illegal standpipes plugged in by private citizens all along the Claudian aqueduct. Silver bars sparkling all the way to Rome like the crystal waters of the Cyrillian spring. I wished Petro and I had done it ten years before. Passing the Capena Gate lock-up, I nipped in to see the loafers from the cook-shop whom I'd seen being arrested that morning for spying on the senator. I was out of luck. Pertinax had let them go. No evidence to hold them, he maintained. I gazed at the duty-guard with my world-weary fellow-comrade sigh. Typical. Did he bother to question them? A few friendly words. Brilliant. What about this Pertinax? Knows it all, the squad he complained. We were both acquainted with the type. We exchanged a painful look. Is he just inefficient, or would you say it was something else? I'd say I don't like him, but I say that about them all. I grinned. Thank you. Look, I cajoled, frankly. What's the word on an ingot of government lead? This is unofficially official, if you understand what I mean. This was a lark. I didn't understand what I was saying myself. He insisted he was under strict orders to say nothing. I chinked some coinage his way. Never fails. A drayman handed it in last week, turned up hoping for a reward. The magistrate himself came down to look. The drayman lives, another magic chink, in a river booth on the Trans-Siberina bank, at the sign of the turbot, near the Sulpician Bridge. I found the booth, but not the drayman. Three days after his horse stumbled over the silver pig in the dark, he was dredged out of the tiber by two men fishing from a raft. They took him to Tiber Island, the medical hospice at the temple of Iscalapis. Most of their patients die, but it didn't worry the drayman. He was already dead. Before leaving the island, I leaned on the parapet of the old Fabrician Bridge and did some hard thinking. Someone approached in that all too casual way, the way that is never casual at all. New Falco? Who wants to know, Princess? My name's Astia. You asking about the man who was drowned? I guessed Astia was the drayman's floozy. She was a thin, bleached waterfront shrimp with a tired, hard waterfront face. Best to know where you are. You his woman? I asked her straight out. Astia laughed bitterly. Not any longer. You were the Praetorians? She spat at me. I played down my astonishment. Life's too short. I waited after that. It was the only thing to do, since I had no idea what I was waiting for. She seemed to consider whether I could be trusted, then after a moment, out it spilled. I came here afterwards. I didn't care about him. I only wanted information. Tell him anything? What do you think? He was good to me when he had any money. I went to the temple. I buried him myself. Falco, he may have been found in the river, but I know he didn't drown. They told me at the temple he must have tipped him when he was drunk. But when he was drunk— That was probably quite often, but I had more tact than to ask. He used to lie down in the cart and let the horse walk him home. Anyone find the cart? Left in the cattle market for him, minus the horse. Hmm. What did the guards want, Princess? He found something valuable. He wouldn't tell me what, but it frightened him. He handed it in at the nearest lock-up instead of selling it himself. The guards knew he found it. They didn't know what he'd done with it. So it was not the guards who snatched young Sasha. Unlikely, anyway. She'd not have escaped so easily. She might never have escaped at all. I'll have to speak to them. Any chance of a name? Astia knew very little. Their captain, she told me, was called Julius Frontinus. As a member of an elite regiment, he undoubtedly possessed the full three names of a substantial man. But two were enough for me to pin him down. For the first time in my life, I volunteered to face an interview with the Emperor's Praetorian guards.

=== CHAPTER 15: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 15 ===
 Chapter 15 The Praetorian camp was on the far side of the city. I walked slowly. I was expecting when I got there to be crushed like an eggshell beneath a guard's heavy boot. I recognized Fontanus at once. He wore an enameled breastplate and a great silver buckle on his belt. But he once learned his alphabet sharing a stool under the primary school awning at the Didius Festus. To Julius Fontanus, therefore, I was a national hero's baby brother, and since he could no longer take Festus to a tavern and get him joyously drunk, because Festus was dead in the desert in Judea, he took me. It was a discreet, well-run winery way out in the northeast corner of Rome near the Viminale Gate full of soldiers from the city regiments and very businesslike. There was no food. There were no women. There was every kind of liquor, warm and cold, spiced or straight, charged well over the odds, though I was not allowed to pay. On my own, I'd never have got a foot indoors. With Fontanus, no one gave me a second glance. We sat among a group of tall, well-padded men who openly overheard but never spoke. Fontanus must have known them. They seemed to know whatever he was going to say. Getting him to say it took a while. When a man like that invites you out drinking, it's understood that, prior to business, there must be ceremonial. Ours, in honor of me and as a pleasure for him, was to discuss heroes and the heroism until we were both maudlin drunk. After we talked about Festus, and before I passed out, I managed to ask some questions. Before Fontanus sent me home in a builder's wagon with a load of ridging tiles, he managed to answer them. Why ever did he do it? Fontanus was still musing. First up the town wall at Bethel, so first dead. Nothing to do for the rest of eternity but let his gravestone whiten in the desert sun. Lunatic. Wanted to cash his deposit with the burial club. Couldn't bear losing all those stoppages from his pay. So, patriotic brother, hail and farewell. It was two years since Festus died, towards the end of Vespasian's Galilean campaign, though so much had happened in the city since then that it seemed much longer. Yet I could not believe he'd gone. In some ways I never will. I'm still waiting for a message to say Festus has landed back at Ostia, so will I please bring him a wagon and some wineskins, because he's run out of cash but has met some lads on the boat and he'd like to entertain. I shall probably be waiting for that message all my life. It was good to say his name, but I'd had enough. Perhaps it showed. I'd drunk enough too, and may have given the impression I was likely to be sick. Despite this, Fontanus refilled our cups. Then he hunched up on the bench, obviously ready to talk. Falco. Falco, what's your given name? Marcus, I admitted. Same as Festus, as Fontanus must have known. Marcus! Jupiter. I'll call you Falco. How are you knotted up in this, Falco? There's a reward for the silver picks. Ha, ha. Now, laddie, that's not on. He became wonderfully paternal. This is political. Leave it to the guards. Festus would tell you and he's not here. You take it from me. Listen, I'll spell it out. After four new heads of state in the last twelve months, Verspation makes a relaxing change, but some odd types are still after him. You know how it is. They come sidling up when you're off duty, little men with something big to sell. Silver picks. Everything fell into place. Ex Argentius Britannii, financing a political plot. Who's behind this? That's what the guards want to know, Fontanus told me grimly. I sensed a movement in the men around him. I said carefully, not looking at any of them. Loyalty to the emperor. If you like, Julius Fontanus laughed. They pride themselves on loyalty. In their time, the Praetorians have physically hoiked new emperors onto the throne. They crowned Claudius that way, and in the year of the four emperors, even a barbered booby like Otto could snatch the empire once he swung Praetorian support. To buy them would take a private mint, but someone had braved the British weather to arrange just that. When they approached me, Fontanus said, I asked for proof, stalling for time. They turned up two days afterwards with a hallmark bar. My troopers were tracking the Weevils back to their biscuit when they scarpered and dropped the loot. Having tried to lift it, I could see why. We lost them. And when we went back, we'd lost the bar, too. Once we put spies into the waterfront drinking-hulls, we soon heard of a drayman who was boasting he'd found something that would win him a golden thank you from the emperor himself. Someone less gentle than the guards obviously heard of him, too. He gave me a heavy stare. There was a cold wet patch on my under tunic against the hollow of my chest. It had nothing to do with the drink. Vespasian's no fool, Falco. He may have jumped up from nothing, but he did it on clever judgment and guts. We reckoned he must be on to this. And now here you are. You informing for the palace, Sunshine? You on some special payroll to cover Vespasian if the guards let him down? Not as far as I know, Julius. I was beginning to realize just how much I didn't know.
=== END OF CHAPTER 15 ===

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Character Identification & Aliases**
   Use advanced reasoning to identify when different names/titles refer to the same person
Examples: "Didius Falco" = "Falco", "the young prince" = "Prince Adrian" = "Adrian"
Merge all references into a single character entry using the most complete/formal name

2. **Physical Description Building**
   Extract ALL physical details mentioned about each character FROM HEAD TO TOE
CRITICAL: Always describe the complete person for full body portraits:
- HEAD/HAIR: Hair color, style, length, texture, any head coverings, hair accessories
- FACE: Eyes, nose, mouth, skin tone, facial hair, distinguishing features
- BODY: Build, height, posture, skin marks, tattoos, scars
- CLOTHING: Every layer from top to bottom, colors, materials, condition
- FEET/FOOTWEAR: ALWAYS include footwear details (boots, sandals, shoes, bare feet, etc.)
If feet/footwear not mentioned in text, note "footwear not specified" but suggest appropriate footwear for the character's status/setting
Note when new details are revealed (e.g., a birthmark mentioned for the first time in chapter 5)

3. **Character Evolution & Sub-Characteristics**
   Identify when a character's appearance changes significantly
Create sub-characteristics for major transformations:
* Age progression (young prince → middle-aged king → elderly ruler)
* Status changes affecting appearance (peasant → knight → lord)
* Physical changes (injuries, scars, weight changes, hair changes)
* Costume/role changes (disguises, different outfits for different scenes)
   
4. **Detailed Appearance Descriptions**
   Make descriptions vivid and specific FOR FULL BODY PORTRAITS
For baseDescription: Include chapter references and detailed analysis from head to toe
For imagePrompt: Create clean COMPLETE head-to-toe visual descriptions without chapter refs
CRITICAL for imagePrompt:
- Start with age, gender, overall build
- Describe head/hair in detail (color, style, length, accessories)
- Include all facial features
- Describe complete outfit from top to bottom
- ALWAYS end with footwear (even if you must infer appropriate footwear)
Example: "tall man, approximately 6'2", broad shoulders, athletic build" → "tall man, 6'2", broad shoulders, athletic build, short dark hair, brown eyes, weathered face with realistic wrinkles, black tunic, leather belt, dark trousers, worn leather boots"
The goal is a COMPLETE person that AI can generate as a full body portrait
IMPORTANT: Describe realistic human proportions and features, avoid exaggerated features

5. **Chapter Tracking**
   - For the main character entry: track all chapters where ANY version appears
   - For each sub-characteristic: track specific chapters where that version appears
   - This allows determining which version of a character is active in any given chapter
   - IMPORTANT: Include chapter numbers from ALL the chapters you just analyzed (13, 14, 15)
