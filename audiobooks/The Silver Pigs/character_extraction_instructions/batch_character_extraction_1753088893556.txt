=== CHAPTER 11: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 11 ===
 Chapter 11 The forum was cooler and quieter than when I was here with Sasha before, especially in the long colonnade where money-changers offered safe deposits for nervous citizens. The Camillus family banked with a grinning Bithynian who'd invested unhealthily in excess body fat. Sasha whispered a number to identify her property. Happy Face unlocked her box. It was a large box, although what was inside turned out to be comparatively small. The box lid fell back. Sasha Camillina stood to one side. When Petra and I peered in, her savings were even less impressive than mine. Her uncle hired her this strong box as her sensible discipline, but she owned no more than ten gold coins and a few decent pieces of jewellery that her aunt thought she was too young yet to wear. It was a point of view. She was old enough for me. Our object of inquiry was folded up in felt and roped around with hemp. Since the banker was watching us with frank Bithynian curiosity, Petronius gave me a hand to drag it out unwrapped. It seemed impossibly heavy. It was like we'd borrowed a handcart from my brother-in-law the plasterer, who was out of work as usual. My brother-in-law was not out of work because all the walls in Rome were sound and smooth. It was because people in Rome would rather look at bare slats than employ a boss-eyed, bone-idle swine like him. We staggered off with our trolley creaking under the weight. Petro let me do most of the work. "'Don't hurt yourself,' Sasha had the grace to exclaim. Petronius winked at her. "'Not as puny as he looks. Does secret weight training in a gladiator's gym. Use your muscles, Blossom.' "'You must tell me sometime,' I gasped in retaliation, "'why my sister Victorina calls you Primrose.' He said nothing, but he blushed. I swear he did. Fortunately, Rome is a sophisticated city. Two men with a girl and a handcart can crawl into a wine shop without causing comment. We moved down a shady side street and plunged indoors. I bagged a table in a dark corner while Petro laid on some hot pies. It took both of us to raise the precious object up onto the table with a thud. Cautiously we peeled back the felt. "'Shades of Hades,' Petronius let out. "'I could see why Uncle Decimus did not want this new baby announced in the Daily Gazette.' Sasha Kamelina had no idea what it was. Petro and I knew. Both of us felt slightly sick. Petro, with his iron stomach, nevertheless leaned back on his joint-stool and snapped his teeth into a vegetable pie. Rather than surrender to unhappy memories, I bit into one too. Mine was basically rabbit with chicken livers and, I think, juniper. Not bad. There was a plate of pork, titbits. We let Sasha chew on those.' "'That lonely hole of a customs post,' Petro reminisced in horror, stuck on the Sabrina estuary the wrong side of the frontier. Nothing to do but count the coracles floating in the mist and keep one eye open in case the dark little men came over the river on a raid. Oh dear gods, Falco, remember the rain.' I remembered the rain. The long drear rain in southwest Britain is unforgettable. "'Falco, whatever is it?' Sasha hissed. I said, relishing the drama. Sasha Kamelina, this is a silver pig.'

=== CHAPTER 12: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 12 ===
 Chapter 12 It was an ingot of lead. It weighed two hundred Roman pounds. I tried to explain once to a woman I knew how heavy that was. Not a lot heavier than you. You're a tall girl, quite a solid piece. A bridegroom could just about heave you over his threshold and not lose his silly smile. The winch I was insulting happened to be a substantial armful, though by no means overweight. It sounds unkind, but if you've ever tried picking up a well-fed young lady, you'll appreciate the comparison was fairly exact. In fact, lifting this dense grey slab before we knew what we were doing had left two of us with bad backs. Petronius and I gazed at the silver pig like an old and not entirely convenient friend. Whatever is it? Sasha demanded. I told her. Why do you call them pigs? I explained that when pressure saw is being refined, molten metal runs away from the furnaces into a long channel where moulds for the ingots lead off down each side, like sucking piglets beside their mother sow. Petronius stared at me sceptically while I said this. Sometimes Petro seems amazed by the things I claim to know. This valuable porker was a long, dull block of metal, about 20 inches long by five wide and four deep, slightly bevelled at the sides, with the emperor's name and the date on one long edge. It looked nothing, but a man who tried to carry it would soon find himself bent double. 24 ladles of molten ore to each standard mould, not quite too heavy to handle, but difficult to steal. Worth it though, if you could. The silver yield from Mendip's ore is remarkably high, on average 130 ounces to the tonne. I wondered whether the silver had already been extracted from the bauble on the table. The government claims a monopoly of precious ore. Wherever it came from, this belonged in the mint. We rolled it over and banged it topside up, looking for an official stamp. It was stamped all right. T-C-L-T-R-I-F. Some new piece of nonsense. Not once, but four times, then. E-X-A-R-G-B-R-I-T. The old familiar mark we half hoped and half dreaded to find. Petronius groaned. Britain, a perfect signature. Someone must be sweating. An uncomfortable feeling struck us both at the same time. Better move, Petro suggested. Shall I tidy this away? Our usual place? You take the girl? I nodded. Falco, what's happening? Sasha demanded excitedly. He's putting the silver pig somewhere smelly, where felons shall be too sensitive to look, I said. You're going home. And I need an urgent chat with your uncle Decimus.

=== CHAPTER 13: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 13 ===
 Chapter 13 I took Sasha Kamelina home in a sedan chair. There was room for two. She was a diminutive scrap, and I could so rarely afford enough to eat that the bearers let us both ride. I stayed silent for a long time, so once she worked out I was no longer disgruntled with her, she chattered. I listened without listening. She was too young to sit in peace after a surprise. I was beginning to be annoyed with the entire Kamelis family. Nothing any of them ever said was true or complete unless it turned into something I preferred not to hear. My open-ended contract had led me down a cul-de-sac. Why are you so quiet? Sasha demanded suddenly. Are you wishing you could steal the silver pig? I said nothing. Naturally, I was wondering how that might be arranged. Do you ever have any money, Falco? Sometimes. What do you do with it? I told her I paid the rent. I see, she commented gravely. She was looking up at me with those great unsettling eyes. Her expression saddened into melting reproach for my aggressiveness. I wanted to suggest it was a bad idea to turn a look like that on men with whom she found herself alone, though I said nothing because I foresaw difficulties explaining why. Didius Falco, what do you really do with it? I send it to my mother. My tone of voice left her unsure whether I meant it, which was how I liked a woman to be left. At that time, I thought a man should never tell women what he does with his money. Those days were the days, of course, before I was married and had this issue placed in true perspective by my wife. What I really did with my money in those days was that sometimes I paid the rent. More often, not. Then, after deducting unavoidable expenses, I sent half to Mamar. I gave the rest to the young woman my brother never found the time to marry before he was killed in Judea, and the child he never even discovered he had. None of that was any business of a senator's niece. I dumped the girl on her relieved aunt. Senators' wives, in my scheme, fall into three types. The ones who sleep with senators, but not the senators who married them, the ones who sleep with gladiators, and a few who stay at home. Before Vespasian, the first two types were everywhere. There were even more afterwards, because when Vespasian became emperor, while he and his wife were married, he was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. He was a very good man. She glanced first at Sasha, then her shrewd black eyes flicked over me. She was just the sort of sensible matron a bachelor would be lucky to find when he was presented with an illegitimate child he felt unable to ignore. I could see why the nifty Publius parked his Sasha here. Julia Justa, the senator's wife, took back her lost niece without fuss. She would ask her questions later, once the household settled down. Just the sort of decent, deserving woman who has the unhappy luck to be married to a man who dabbles in illegal currency, a man so inept he hires his own informer to expose him. I made my way to the library and marched in on Decimus unannounced. Surprise! A senator who collects not grubby Greek antiques, but ingots engraved artistically in the by the government. You're in enough trouble, sir. Why hire me as well? He had a shifty expression for a moment. Then he seemed to straighten up. I suppose a politician gets used to people calling him a liar. Dangerous ground, Falco. When you calm down—I was perfectly calm, furious, but lucid as glass. Senator, the silver pig must be stolen. I don't rate you as a thief. For one thing, I sneered, if you'd gone to the trouble of stealing British silver, you'd take much more care of your loot. What's your involvement? Official, he said, then had second thoughts. That was just as well, since I didn't believe him. Semi-official. I still didn't believe him. I choked back a laugh. And semi-corrupt. He brushed my bluntness aside. Falco, this has to be in confidence. The stale crust of his family's confidence was the last thing I welcomed. The ingot was found after a scuffle in the street and handed in to the magistrate's office. I know the preta for this sector. He's the man I dine with and his nephew gave a posting to my son. We discussed the ingot, naturally. Ah, just among friends. Whatever he'd done, to a man of his station, I was being unacceptably rude. His patience surprised me. I watched him closely. He was just as intently observing me. I would suspect he wanted a favor, had he been a different class of man. My daughter Helena took a letter to Britain. We have relatives there. My brother-in-law is the British Secretary of Finance. I wrote to him. All in the family, I see, I scoffed again. I've forgotten how clannish these people can be. Little pockets of reliable friends sewn into every province from Palestine to the pillars of Hercules. Falco, please. Gaius, my brother-in-law, conducted a skeleton audit. He discovered there'd been a steady wastage from the British minds at least since the year of the four emperors. Theft on a grand scale, Falco. Once we heard that, we wanted our evidence secure. My friend the preta asked my help. Using Sasha Kemalina's bank box was, I regret to say, my own bright idea. I told him our new hideout. He looked ill. Petro had taken the silver pig to Lenia's laundry. We would be banking it in her vat of bleaching pee. The senator made no comment on either our snaffling his exhibit or its pungent hiding place. What he offered me was much more dangerous. Are you busy at the moment? I was never busy. As an informer, I was not that good. Look, Falco, are you interested in helping us? We can't trust the official machine. Someone must already have talked. What about here? I interrupted. I never mentioned the ingot here. I took Sasha to bank it without telling her why, then forbade her to talk. He paused. She's a good child. I gestured wry acknowledgement. Falco, I admit we were careless before we grasped the implications. But if the preta's organization leaks, we can't take further risks. Your face seems to fit this job. Semi-official and semi-corrupt. Sarcastic old beggar. I realized the man had a quietly wicked streak. He was shrewder than he liked to appear. He certainly knew what preoccupied me. He ran one hand over that upright bush of hair, then said awkwardly, I had a meeting today at the palace. I can't say more than that, but with the empire to reconstruct after Nero and the Civil War, those ingots are sorely needed by the treasury. In our talks, your name came up. I understand you had a brother. My face really set. Excuse me, he exclaimed abruptly in that concerned way the occasional aristocrat has, which I never entirely trust. It was an apology, one I ignored. I'd not have these people discussing my brother. Well, would you want the job? My principal will honor your usual rates. I gather you inflated them for me. If you find the missing silver, you can expect a substantial bonus. I'd like to meet your principal, I snapped. My idea of a bonus may not be the same as his. Decimus Camillus snapped straight back. My principal's idea of a bonus is the best you will get. I knew it meant working for some snooty secretariat of jumped-up scribes who would slash my expenses, given I have a chance, but I took the job. I must have been mad. Still, he was Sasha's uncle, and I felt sorry for his wife. There was something odd about this case. By the way, sir, did you set a slick lynx called Attius Pertinax on my tail? He looked annoyed. No. Has he ties with your family? No, he chipped in impatiently, then checked. Nothing was simple here. A slight connection, he corrected himself, and by now his expression had deliberately cleared. Business links with my brother. Did you tell your brother that Sasha was with me? I had no opportunity. Someone did. He asked Pertinax to arrest me. The senator smiled. I do apologize. My brother has been frantically worried about his daughter. He'll be delighted you brought her home. Tidily cleared up. Petronius Longus had said my description was known, so an idyll might track me down. Pertinax and Publius assumed I was a villain. Big Brother Decimus had admitted to mention to little brother Publius the fact that he'd hired me. I was not surprised. I come from a large family myself. There were lots of things festers had never remembered to tell me.

=== CHAPTER 14: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 14 ===
 Chapter 14 This silver leak was a clever scheme. The British mines, which in my day were guarded so cautiously by the army, had apparently been tapped off as neatly as those illegal standpipes plugged in by private citizens all along the Claudian aqueduct. Silver bars sparkling all the way to Rome like the crystal waters of the Cyrillian spring. I wished Petro and I had done it ten years before. Passing the Capena Gate lock-up, I nipped in to see the loafers from the cook-shop whom I'd seen being arrested that morning for spying on the senator. I was out of luck. Pertinax had let them go. No evidence to hold them, he maintained. I gazed at the duty-guard with my world-weary fellow-comrade sigh. Typical. Did he bother to question them? A few friendly words. Brilliant. What about this Pertinax? Knows it all, the squad he complained. We were both acquainted with the type. We exchanged a painful look. Is he just inefficient, or would you say it was something else? I'd say I don't like him, but I say that about them all. I grinned. Thank you. Look, I cajoled, frankly. What's the word on an ingot of government lead? This is unofficially official, if you understand what I mean. This was a lark. I didn't understand what I was saying myself. He insisted he was under strict orders to say nothing. I chinked some coinage his way. Never fails. A drayman handed it in last week, turned up hoping for a reward. The magistrate himself came down to look. The drayman lives, another magic chink, in a river booth on the Trans-Siberina bank, at the sign of the turbot, near the Sulpician Bridge. I found the booth, but not the drayman. Three days after his horse stumbled over the silver pig in the dark, he was dredged out of the tiber by two men fishing from a raft. They took him to Tiber Island, the medical hospice at the temple of Iscalapis. Most of their patients die, but it didn't worry the drayman. He was already dead. Before leaving the island, I leaned on the parapet of the old Fabrician Bridge and did some hard thinking. Someone approached in that all too casual way, the way that is never casual at all. New Falco? Who wants to know, Princess? My name's Astia. You asking about the man who was drowned? I guessed Astia was the drayman's floozy. She was a thin, bleached waterfront shrimp with a tired, hard waterfront face. Best to know where you are. You his woman? I asked her straight out. Astia laughed bitterly. Not any longer. You were the Praetorians? She spat at me. I played down my astonishment. Life's too short. I waited after that. It was the only thing to do, since I had no idea what I was waiting for. She seemed to consider whether I could be trusted, then after a moment, out it spilled. I came here afterwards. I didn't care about him. I only wanted information. Tell him anything? What do you think? He was good to me when he had any money. I went to the temple. I buried him myself. Falco, he may have been found in the river, but I know he didn't drown. They told me at the temple he must have tipped him when he was drunk. But when he was drunk— That was probably quite often, but I had more tact than to ask. He used to lie down in the cart and let the horse walk him home. Anyone find the cart? Left in the cattle market for him, minus the horse. Hmm. What did the guards want, Princess? He found something valuable. He wouldn't tell me what, but it frightened him. He handed it in at the nearest lock-up instead of selling it himself. The guards knew he found it. They didn't know what he'd done with it. So it was not the guards who snatched young Sasha. Unlikely, anyway. She'd not have escaped so easily. She might never have escaped at all. I'll have to speak to them. Any chance of a name? Astia knew very little. Their captain, she told me, was called Julius Frontinus. As a member of an elite regiment, he undoubtedly possessed the full three names of a substantial man. But two were enough for me to pin him down. For the first time in my life, I volunteered to face an interview with the Emperor's Praetorian guards.

=== CHAPTER 15: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 15 ===
 Chapter 15 The Praetorian camp was on the far side of the city. I walked slowly. I was expecting when I got there to be crushed like an eggshell beneath a guard's heavy boot. I recognized Fontanus at once. He wore an enameled breastplate and a great silver buckle on his belt. But he once learned his alphabet sharing a stool under the primary school awning at the Didius Festus. To Julius Fontanus, therefore, I was a national hero's baby brother, and since he could no longer take Festus to a tavern and get him joyously drunk, because Festus was dead in the desert in Judea, he took me. It was a discreet, well-run winery way out in the northeast corner of Rome near the Viminale Gate full of soldiers from the city regiments and very businesslike. There was no food. There were no women. There was every kind of liquor, warm and cold, spiced or straight, charged well over the odds, though I was not allowed to pay. On my own, I'd never have got a foot indoors. With Fontanus, no one gave me a second glance. We sat among a group of tall, well-padded men who openly overheard but never spoke. Fontanus must have known them. They seemed to know whatever he was going to say. Getting him to say it took a while. When a man like that invites you out drinking, it's understood that, prior to business, there must be ceremonial. Ours, in honor of me and as a pleasure for him, was to discuss heroes and the heroism until we were both maudlin drunk. After we talked about Festus, and before I passed out, I managed to ask some questions. Before Fontanus sent me home in a builder's wagon with a load of ridging tiles, he managed to answer them. Why ever did he do it? Fontanus was still musing. First up the town wall at Bethel, so first dead. Nothing to do for the rest of eternity but let his gravestone whiten in the desert sun. Lunatic. Wanted to cash his deposit with the burial club. Couldn't bear losing all those stoppages from his pay. So, patriotic brother, hail and farewell. It was two years since Festus died, towards the end of Vespasian's Galilean campaign, though so much had happened in the city since then that it seemed much longer. Yet I could not believe he'd gone. In some ways I never will. I'm still waiting for a message to say Festus has landed back at Ostia, so will I please bring him a wagon and some wineskins, because he's run out of cash but has met some lads on the boat and he'd like to entertain. I shall probably be waiting for that message all my life. It was good to say his name, but I'd had enough. Perhaps it showed. I'd drunk enough too, and may have given the impression I was likely to be sick. Despite this, Fontanus refilled our cups. Then he hunched up on the bench, obviously ready to talk. Falco. Falco, what's your given name? Marcus, I admitted. Same as Festus, as Fontanus must have known. Marcus! Jupiter. I'll call you Falco. How are you knotted up in this, Falco? There's a reward for the silver picks. Ha, ha. Now, laddie, that's not on. He became wonderfully paternal. This is political. Leave it to the guards. Festus would tell you and he's not here. You take it from me. Listen, I'll spell it out. After four new heads of state in the last twelve months, Verspation makes a relaxing change, but some odd types are still after him. You know how it is. They come sidling up when you're off duty, little men with something big to sell. Silver picks. Everything fell into place. Ex Argentius Britannii, financing a political plot. Who's behind this? That's what the guards want to know, Fontanus told me grimly. I sensed a movement in the men around him. I said carefully, not looking at any of them. Loyalty to the emperor. If you like, Julius Fontanus laughed. They pride themselves on loyalty. In their time, the Praetorians have physically hoiked new emperors onto the throne. They crowned Claudius that way, and in the year of the four emperors, even a barbered booby like Otto could snatch the empire once he swung Praetorian support. To buy them would take a private mint, but someone had braved the British weather to arrange just that. When they approached me, Fontanus said, I asked for proof, stalling for time. They turned up two days afterwards with a hallmark bar. My troopers were tracking the Weevils back to their biscuit when they scarpered and dropped the loot. Having tried to lift it, I could see why. We lost them. And when we went back, we'd lost the bar, too. Once we put spies into the waterfront drinking-hulls, we soon heard of a drayman who was boasting he'd found something that would win him a golden thank you from the emperor himself. Someone less gentle than the guards obviously heard of him, too. He gave me a heavy stare. There was a cold wet patch on my under tunic against the hollow of my chest. It had nothing to do with the drink. Vespasian's no fool, Falco. He may have jumped up from nothing, but he did it on clever judgment and guts. We reckoned he must be on to this. And now here you are. You informing for the palace, Sunshine? You on some special payroll to cover Vespasian if the guards let him down? Not as far as I know, Julius. I was beginning to realize just how much I didn't know.

=== CHAPTER 16: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 16 ===
 Chapter 16 I went back to see the senator next day. After my party with Frontinus, it was an afternoon call. Let's submit details of my morning. Most of it was spent in bed, though there were spasms of painful activity from time to time. When I arrived at his house, the senator had mild indigestion after lunch. I had severe indigestion, though I'd not been able to face lunch. I stormed in. He was beginning to judge my moods by the suddenness of my arrival in his sanctuary. Today I popped up like a playwright's villain, cackling with malice which I was eager to share with an audience. Camillus Verus had the goodness to set aside his paperwork and let me spout my colorful spume. No silver bars, but I stubbed my toe on quite a plot. You lied to me, sir. than a secore at the Temple of Isis, to much less good purpose, but just as expertly told. Falco, can I explain? No. He owed me a rant, at least. My violent excitement held him mesmerized. Spare me, senator. I don't touch political work. I don't rate the risk. My mother gave one son to Vespasian in Galilee. I'm her only survivor, and surviving suits me fine. He looked touchy. He considered I was belittling the political aspects. Since I considered he was, we were draftsmen in stalemate. You'll see Vespasian assassinated. Oh, Falco, plunge the country back into civil war. Ruin the empire? More fighting, more uncertainty, more Roman blood spilled on Roman streets? Whoever paid heavy salaries to protect the emperor, I rasped, I'm paid with lies and promises. Suddenly I lost patience. There was no future for me here. They had deceived me, and they tried to use me. Cleverer men than this had mistaken me for a country clown in a farce. Cleverer men had discovered the mistake. More quietly, I brought the ridiculous piece of theatre to an end. Vespasian doesn't like informers. I don't like emperors. I thought I liked you, but any poor spat out of his depth can make a mistake. Good day, sir. I stormed out again. He let me go. I'd noticed before Decimus Camillus Verus was a shrewd man. I was striding angrily across the hall with its spluttery fountain when I heard a hiss. Falco! It was Sasha. Come into the garden. And talk. It would have been incorrect to gossip with the young lady of the house, even if I'd remained in her uncle's employ. I'd try not to upset senators by meddling with their wards in their own front halls where the servants see everything that goes on. If I spoke to Sasha at all, which I must do now since her noble personage had spoken to me, any chat must be quick, and we should stay in the hall. I scuffed the marble floor tiles with my heel. Oh, diddius Falco, please! From sheer spite I followed her. She led me to an internal courtyard I'd not seen before. Clearing white stonework fought the cold black green of clipped cypress trees. There were cooing doves and a bigger fountain, which worked. A peacock screeched behind one of the lichen-covered urns, which were planted with stately white lilies. It was a cool, pretty, quiet place, but I refused to sink into the shade under the pergola and be soothed. Sasha sat. I faced her on my feet with my arms folded. In some ways this was just as well. However much I was tempted to slide an arm around her, I denied myself the chance. She was wearing a red dress hemmed with damson braid. It emphasized the paleness of her skin beneath the artificial colors she applied. Leaning towards me with a pinched and troubled face, she was for a moment a one little creature. She seemed apologetic on behalf of her family, though as she tried to win me over she became more earnest than I'd ever seen her. Somebody at some time had taught her how to stand at ground. I overheard. Falko, you can't let Vespasian be murdered. He's going to be a good emperor. I doubt it, I said. He's not cruel. He's not mad. He leads a simple life. He works hard. He's old, but he has a gifted son. This came out with spirit. She believed it, though I knew such a theory could not originate with her. I was surprised to find the emperor could claim such support, for he lacked all the traditional advantages. None of Vespasian's family had ever held high office. I did not blame him for that. Neither had any of mine. Who stuffed you with this horsehair? I raged. Helena. Helena. The cousin she'd mentioned. The senator's daughter. The one some poor sap of a husband with a great deal of luck had managed to divorce. You see. So what she liked, this Helena of yours. She's wonderful, Sasha exclaimed at once. But then she decided with equal certainty, you wouldn't like her that much. Why's that? I laughed. She shrugged. I never met her cousin, yet my instinct had been to resent the woman ever since Sasha first tried to use her name as a disguise when she'd not trust me. In fact, my only real grudge against Helena was that I could see she wielded considerable influence over Sasha Kemelina. I preferred to influence Sasha myself. I reckon Sasha was wrong anyway. I normally liked women, but if this Helena felt protective towards her younger relative, as I gathered she did, the chances were that she would not like me. I wrote to her, Sasha explained, as if she read my thoughts. I said nothing. I was leaving. There was no longer anything to say. I stood half aware of the clean sense of summer flowers and the lazy warmth beating off the stones. I tell Helena everything. I stared at her more kindly, smitten with unease. It's an odd fact. You feel more ashamed when you've nothing to answer for than when you're disguising some brazen act of scandal. Since I was still silent, Sasha continued to talk. It was her one annoying habit. She never could sit quiet. You're really going away. I won't see you again. There's something I want to say. Marcus Didius Falco. I've been wondering for days how to— She used my formal name. No one ever did that. Her respectful tone was more than I could bear. I'd stumbled into a real emergency. My anger fled. Don't! I exclaimed urgently. Sasha, believe me. When you need to spend days composing your script, the reason is, it's best to say nothing at all. She hesitated. You don't know— I was a spare-time poet. There were many things I would never know, but I recognise this. Oh, Sasha. I know. For one fantastic moment, I flashed into a dream where I took Sasha Camilina into my life. I flashed back. Only a fool tries to step across the barriers of rank in that way. A man can buy himself into the middle class or have the gold ring donated to him for services to the emperor, especially if the services are of a dubious kind. But so long as her father and her uncle knew what they were about—and her uncle must, Then even with that queer problem of having no mother to name, Sasha Camilina would be disposed of in some way to enhance her own position and their family bank account. Our two lives could never converge. At heart, she understood, for despite her brave attempt, she stared at her toes in their knotted gold sandals, biting her lip but accepting what I said. If I need you, she began in a subdued tone. I replied briskly, for my own sake. You won't. In your sweet sheltered life, you've no need of anyone like me. And Sasha Camilina, I really don't need you. I left quickly, so I should not see her face. I walked home. Rome, my city, which had been until then a never failing solace, lay before me like a woman, secretive and beautiful, demanding and rewarding, eternally seductive. For the first time in my life, I refused to be seduced.

=== CHAPTER 17: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 17 ===
 CHAPTER XVII I did see Sasha Kamelina again. She asked me to meet her. Of course, I went. I went as soon as I could. By then summer was nuzzling autumn's neck. The days seemed equally long and hot, but towards dusk the air began to cool more quickly. I went out to the Campania for a grape-gathering holiday, but my heart was never in it, and I came home. I'd not been able to shift the silver pigs from my mind. This puzzle had gripped my interest. No amount of raging at the way I'd been teased along by Decimus Camillus could alter that. Whenever I saw him, Petronius Longus asked after my progress. He knew how I felt, but was too enthralled for tact. I started to avoid him, which depressed me even more. In addition, the whole world was watching our new Emperor Vespasian. There was no possibility of gossiping at the barbers or the baths, the racetrack or the theatre without an awkward twinge because I could not forget what I knew. For six weeks or longer I lay low. I'd bungled divorce cases, failed to serve rits, forgot the dates of court appearances, tore ligaments at the gym, insulted my family, dodged my landlord, drank too much, ate too little, gave up women for good. If I went to the theatre, I lost the thread of the plot. Then one day, Lenia cornered me. Falco, your girlfriend's been. Out of habit I demanded which. I still like to imply I was harassed by half-naked Tripolitanian acrobats every afternoon. Lenia knew perfectly well I'd given up women. She missed the clip of their little sandals and the giggles on the stairs when I brought them in. She also missed the shrieks of indignation when the mother swept them out with the dust the next day. Little Miss Dainty with the pedigree and bangles. I let her pee in the bleach vat, then she wrote a note upstairs. I took the stairs in a rush. I reached the apartment all a-splutter with a hacking throat. My mother had been. A pile of mended tunics, a picture of a chariot drawn on a slate by my niece, a mullet in a covered dish. I flung these aside as I searched. The note was in my bedroom. An odd pang caught me to imagine Sasha there. She pegged her message on my pile of poetry under the jet bracelet that I knew. I wondered if she noticed that Aglaya, a radiant goddess, was really about her. All the girls in my odes are called Aglaya. A poet needs to protect himself. Sasha had left me a wooden tablet, unlaced from one of those four-page pocketbooks, and then inscribed deeply with a stylus in a round hand that had never done serious writing. Didius Falco, I know a place where they may keep the silver pigs. If I show you, you can claim your bonus. Will you meet me at the Golden Milestone in two hours? If you're too busy, I will go for you and see— I pounded back downstairs in a blind panic. Linear! Linear! What time was she here? They were waiting for me calmly at the foot of the last flight. Smaractus. Below me shadows moved, their bare feet noiseless on the stone steps. My landlord's gladiators after my unpaid rent. I have an arrangement with a cloakmaker who lives on the second floor that, in an emergency, I can run through his room, fling myself over the balcony onto the firefighting porch, then drop into the street. I'd passed the cloakmaker's door. I half turned back. The door opened. Someone who was not the cloakmaker came out. They were straight from smaractuses in sanitary gym and in full fighting rig. Below me, the type called Miamilons, glistening with oil above their body belts, their right arms padded and ringed with metal from collarbone to fist, their solid, high-crested helmets shaped like curling, sneering fish. Above me, when I whirled round, two light, laughing men in tunics only, but each with a fiendish net coiled on his arm. His fisherman. I whipped back. There he is, Falco! What's the rush? I recognized the one who spoke. I recognized his build. He crouched slightly, in fighting stance, faceless behind his helmet grill. I must have exclaimed, Oh no, not now, oh God, not now! Now, Falco! You can't, oh you can't! Oh, we can! Let's show the men! Then both fishers flung their nets down over my head. I knew as I struggled hopelessly in two ten-foot circles of biting cords that it was going to be much worse than being arrested by the idylles bully boys. If Smaractus was just making his point, they would tenderize me like an octopus slammed on the foreshore rocks. If he found himself a new tenant for upstairs, I was finished. It was going to be as bad as anything could be. My only comfort was that I would know very little about it once I managed to pass out, and that perhaps I would never wake up. There were probably five of them, but it seemed more. The fishers could not be seen with their spiked tridents in the open streets, but the Miamilans had brought their wooden practice swords. As I flailed in the nets, they beat me systematically until I faded in a smother of disjointed sounds. I was coming too. New tenants must be thin on the ground. Perhaps they'd heard what life in a Smaractus apartment is like. The office was mine still. I was waking up. Not in my room, somewhere else. I felt desperately tired. Pain lapped around me as thick as spilt nectar, then I swirled in a torrent of sensation and fierce noise back up from the whirlpool. He's coming round. Say something, Falco, Linear ordered. My brain uttered words. I heard no sound. My cottonball mouth never moved. I felt sorry for this, Falco, if he hurt as much as me. I'd left the world for perhaps thirty seconds, perhaps a hundred years. Wherever I'd been was better than here, and I wanted to go back. Marques! Not Linear anymore. Don't try to talk, son. Linear had sent for my mother. Good heavens. Slowly the red blurb beyond my eyeballs solidified. Slowly I and that other poor man they call Falco fused together. This is... Who said that? Me? Or Falco? Him, I think. My mother's voice, acid with relief, spoke. This is why people keep up with their rent. Linear loomed over me, her neck haggard as a giant lizard. Lie still, she said. I sat up. My mother had helped. Anything to lie down again, but her arm at my back held me upright like a puppeteer's softwood stick. My mother raised my head, holding me under the chin with a firm, neutral grip of a lifelong nurse. She treats me like a hopeless case. She speaks to me as if I were a delinquent child. The loss of my great-hearted brother burns between us like wormwood in the throat, a perpetual reproach. I don't even know what she reproaches me for. I suspect she doesn't know herself. She seemed to believe in me now. Mother said in a voice that forced sense deep into the mash that once had been my brain, saying, I'm worried about the little girl. We read her note. I sent Petronius to find her, but you ought to go. I reached the Forum in a litter, shouldered through the crowds like some gross eunuch with more money than taste. We jostled to the Golden Milestone from which all the roads in the Empire take their distance. I thought of her, waiting to meet me at the heart of the world. No sign of her now. One of Petro's troopers gave me a message to meet his captain in Knapp Lane. The man held back, still expecting someone else. I set off on foot. Hunting for the right back alley, I found some sewersmen, ferreting round a manhole as sewersmen like to do. They were working with more energy than usual. Concrete was being shoveled underground frantically, with not a wine good of refreshment inside. I addressed them with a formality of tone, a reserve for specialists. Sorry to interrupt. Have you possibly had a moment to spot Petronius Longus, the captain of the Aventine Watch? The foreman gave me the benefit of his philosophy of life. Listen, Centurion, when the great drain starts gulping the sacred way into the shit after 500 years, the navvies shoring up the culvert have better things to do than take a census at Passers By. Thank you for your trouble, I replied politely. For once, it worked. Back in the pepper warehouses, he admitted gruffly. Howl crowd of silly devils stirring up the dust. I was already halfway there, calling my thanks. There was no rush. Knapp Lane lay on the south side of the Forum, near the spice markets. It was typical of the steep, twisty side routes that dive off our major streets. Dive off our major streets, only just wide enough for a wagon to force through, clogged with dry mud, littered with broken spars of wood and waste. Shuttles leaned off their hinges overhead, where the buildings jutted over the street, hiding the sky. There was a musty smell of nighttime occupation by degenerates. A cat yelled viciously as I went past. It was the sort of hole where you worry if you see someone coming, and worry if you don't. It seemed a sorry end for the stately caravans that swung the treasures of Arabia, India, and China halfway across the world for sale in Rome. The warehouse I wanted looked abandoned. There was lush vegetation clogging the ruts in its gateway, and a wrecked wagon lurching on one axle outside. I found them in the open yard, Petronius Longus and nearly a dozen men. Even before I turned in at the gate, the voices of saddened professionals warned me what to expect. I'd heard that subdued note so many times before. Petro strode towards me. Marcus! I lost any hope or doubt. He reached me. He grasped both my hands. His eyes flickered over my bruises, too preoccupied to take them in. He would never be hardened. While other men sit in oyster bars being cynical over nothing, Petronius Longus merely gives his slow, tolerant smile. Turning back at some movement, he put an arm round my shoulders, completely unable to tell me what had happened. It didn't matter. I already knew. They'd found her inside the warehouse. I arrived at the moment when they were carrying her out, so that was when I saw her for the last time. Her white dress hung like a hank of wool over a grim trooper's arm, while her head lolled backwards in a way that was unmistakable. Sasha Kamelina was dead.

=== CHAPTER 18: Lindsey Davis - The Silver Pigs - Chapter 18 ===
 Chapter 18 Darkness, flares, the patrol waiting for the magistrate. They coped with strangled prostitutes and fishwives batted with staves, but this touched the Senate. No worse to solve but menacing paperwork. Petronius groaned in despair. We wasted hours searching, squeezed the throats of a trail of pimps who'd watched her, found the lane, batted five different watchmen before we identified the place. Too late. Nothing I could do. Just nothing I could do. This damn city. He loved Rome. They laid her down in the yard. It's usually easy to maintain some detachment at this point. I rarely know the victim. I don't meet the victim until after the crime. That order of events is what I recommend. I covered my face. I was aware of Petronius long as dragging back his men. We'd been colleagues for a long time. We fought life from the same side. He granted me as much leeway as he could. I stood a yard from her. Petronius came to my shoulder. He muttered. Crouching, his big hand softly closed her eyes. He stood by me again. We were both looking down at her. He was looking at Sasha to avoid looking at me. I was looking at Sasha because there was nothing else on this earth that I ever wanted to look at again. Her sweet face was still bright with a flim-flammery a young woman of her station paints on. Beneath, her skin tones were stone-white as alabaster. It was her. Yet it would never be her. There was no light and no laughter, only a motionless, eggshell-white case. It was a corpse. Yet I could not deal with it as a corpse. She can't have realized, Petro murmured. He cleared his throat. That was all. No nasty work. Rape. He meant rape, torture, indignity, indecency. She was dead and this poor fool was trying to tell me she'd not been terrorized. I wanted to rage at him that nothing else mattered. He was trying to tell me it was quick. I could see that. One short, hard, violent upward blow had killed Sasha Canelina before she guessed what the man would do. There was very little blood. She died of shock. What she did when you arrived, I asked. Did she say anything? Routine questions, Marcus. Clean to your routine. Pointless even to ask. Petronius shrugged helplessly, then moved away. So I stood there and was as nearly alone with Sasha as I would ever be again. I wanted to hold her in my arms, but there were too many people. After a while I just dropped down on my heels and stayed with her while Petro kept his squaddies at rest. I could not speak to her, not even in my head. I no longer really looked at her, lest the sluggish wake of her spilt blood should defeat me. I sat there, living through what must have happened. It was the nearest I could come to helping her. It was the only way I could comfort her for dying so alone. I know who it was. He must realize that. One day, however carefully he protects himself, the man will answer to me. She found him there, writing, that was evident. Writing what? Not a tally of the silver bars, for she was wrong. There were no bars, though we turned the deserted warehouse over for days. But he was writing, because a lamp black from the wet ink stained her white dress around the wound. Perhaps she knew him. When she found him, he realized she needed to be silenced, so he stood up and rapidly stabbed her, a rising blow through the heart, once, with his pen. Petronius was right. Sasha Kamelina could not have expected that. I rose. I managed neither to stumble nor to break down. Her father. I'll tell him, stated Petronius drably, a task he so hated. Go home. I'll tell the family. Marcus just go home. I decided after all to let him tell him. I could feel his eyes watching me as I walked away. He wanted to help. He knew there was nothing anyone could do.

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- NEVER use "not specified" or vague terms - provide exhaustive visual details
- Each parameter must be so detailed that an artist could draw it without questions
- Don't just say "military helmet" - describe its exact appearance:
  BAD: "watch captain's helmet"
  GOOD: "bronze bowl-shaped galea with small neck guard, no crest, dented from use"
- Don't use role titles in descriptions, describe the actual visual appearance:
  BAD: "watch insignia"
  GOOD: "small bronze plaque with VII cohort number, worn on leather strap"
- For clothing, describe the exact cut, length, and construction:
  BAD: "dark tunic"
  GOOD: "rough-woven brown wool tunic, knee-length, sleeveless, rope belt"
- Include wear, damage, and realistic details:
  BAD: "military boots"
  GOOD: "worn leather caligae with iron hobnails, straps to mid-calf, left strap repaired"
- Specify exact colors and materials:
  BAD: "dark official colors"
  GOOD: "undyed brown wool with faded edges, leather straps darkened with age"
- For Ancient Rome: describe items as they physically appeared, not their function
- Research actual Roman artifacts and describe those specific items

BATCH PROCESSING STEPS:
1. Read ALL provided chapter transcripts carefully
2. Identify all character mentions across ALL chapters
3. For ANY parameter not explicitly mentioned, create detailed visual descriptions:
   - Research actual artifacts and clothing from Not specified - YOU MUST DETERMINE FROM CONTEXT Not specified - YOU MUST DETERMINE FROM CONTEXT
   - Describe the physical appearance, not the function or title
   - Include texture, wear patterns, construction details, exact measurements
   - Add realistic imperfections: stains, repairs, wear marks, fading
   - Specify exact shades of color, types of fabric, leather quality
4. For existing characters, check if new physical details are revealed in any chapter
5. Determine if any character appears in different states requiring sub-characteristics
6. Include ALL chapter numbers (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) in the chapter arrays
7. VERIFY all parameters are filled with specific visual descriptions
8. ENSURE no modern anachronisms (glasses, watches, modern clothing/uniforms)
9. CRITICAL: When image AI reads your parameters, it should see physical descriptions only
   - "wooden stick about 2 feet long" NOT "authority symbol"
   - "bronze disc with VII etched" NOT "unit insignia"
   - "rough brown wool fabric" NOT "uniform"
