 Prologue, the triumph of the Roman Republic. Who was there so feeble-minded or idle that he would not wish to know how and with what constitution, almost all the inhabited world was conquered and fell under the single dominion of Rome within 53 years? Polybius Proconcil Publius Schipio Emilio N. Stood before the walls of Carthage watching the city burn. After a long bloody siege, the Romans had breached the walls and pierced the heart of their greatest enemy. The Carthaginians had put up a fight, forcing the Romans to conquer the city street by street. But at the end of a week's fighting, the Romans prevailed. After systematically looting the city, Emilio N. Stood ordered Carthage destroyed and its remaining inhabitants either sold into slavery or resettled further inland, far away from their lucrative harbor on the coast of North Africa. Among one of the great cities of the Mediterranean, Carthage was no more. Meanwhile 700 miles to the east, Consolucius Mumius stood before the walls of the Greek city of Corinth. For 50 years, Rome had attempted to control Greek political life without ruling Greece directly. But persistent unrest, disorder and rebellion had forced the Romans to intervene repeatedly. Finally in 146 BC, the Senate dispatched Mumius to end these rebellions once and for all. When he breached the walls of Corinth, he made an example of the rebellious city. As with Carthage, the legions stripped the city of its wealth, tore down buildings, and sold its inhabitants into slavery. By simultaneously destroying Carthage and Corinth in 146, the Roman Republic took a final decisive step toward its imperial destiny. No longer one power among many, Rome now asserted itself as the power in the Mediterranean world. But as Rome's imperial power reached maturity, the Republic itself started to rot from within. The triumph of the Roman Republic was also the beginning of the end of the Roman Republic. The road to Rome's triumph began in central Italy six centuries earlier. According to the official legend, twin babies, Romulus and Remus were found abandoned beside the Tiber River by a shewold who have suckled them back to life. When they came of age, the twins resolved to found a city on the spot where they had been discovered. But an argument over where to place the city's boundary markers led to a quarrel, Romulus killed Remus and became the sole founder of the new city of Rome. The legendary founding date is April 21st, 753 BC. The oft-told story of Romulus and Remus is obviously a myth. That does not mean the story's pure invention. There's archaeological evidence that shows human habitation dates back to the 1200s BC with permanent settlements by early 900, roughly corresponding to the legendary timeline. Contrary to the myth, however, the location of Rome has nothing to do with fortuitous encounters with friendly wolves, but rather strategic economics. Rome sits nestled in a cluster of seven hills, commanding one of the few stable crossings of the Tiber. Most of the early Romans were farmers, but the location allowed them to control the river, establish a marketplace, and defend themselves in case of attack. Their small community was soon stable and prosperous. Rome spent its first 250 years as just another minor kingdom in Italy. As records from those early days were non-existent, later Roman historians relied on the oral tradition of the Seven Kings of Rome to explain the early evolution of their city. Although the evidence was slim, the Romans believed that most of their core public institutions traced their roots to this semi-mythical monarchy. The first king, Romulus, organized the legions, the senate, and the popular assembly. The second king, Numa, introduced priesthoods and religious rituals. The sixth king, Servius Tolius, reformed the assemblies, conducted the first census, and organized the citizens into regional tribes for voting. But though the later Romans credited the kings with laying the political and social foundations of the city, they also believed that kings were ennaffment to the Roman character. The Roman kingdom ended abruptly in 509 when a group of senators chased the last king out of the city and replaced the monarchy with a kingless republic. The new Roman republic was not a free-wheeling democracy. Families that could trace their lineage back to the original senators appointed by Romulus were known as the Patricians, and by custom and law, these families monopolized all political and religious offices. Anyone outside this small aristocratic click was called plebeian. All pleblians, whether poor farmer, prosperous merchant, or rich landowner, were shut out of power. It did not take long for the plebs to agitate for equal rights. As the historian Aapian says, the pleblians and senate of Rome were often at strife with each other, concerning the enactment of laws, the canceling of debts, the division of lands, or the election of magistrates. The running battle between Petrician and plebe became known as the conflict of the orders. About 15 years after the founding of the republic, a debt crisis among the lower-class pleblians finally led to a great showdown. Incents that arbitrary Petrician abuse, the plebs refused to muster for military service when called to face a looming foreign threat. Instead, the plebs withdrew on mass to a hill outside the city and swore to remain there until they were allowed to elect magistrates of their own. The senate yielded and created the plebeian assembly, a popular assembly closed to petitions. This assembly would elect tribunes who acted as guardians against Petrician abuse. Any citizen could seek sanctuary with a tribune at any time for any reason. By sacred oath, the tribunes were declared sacrosanct. When the city limits of Rome, not even a consul could lay a hand on them. They became sentinels against the tyranny of the senatorial aristocracy. But though tension between Petrician and plebbed helped define the early republic, Roman politics was not a class affair. Roman families organized themselves in a complex client patron networks that worked down from the elite Petrician patrons through an array of interconnected plebeian clients. Patrons could expect political and military support from their clients, and clients could expect financial and legal assistance from their patrons. So though the conflict between petitions and plebs occasionally led to explosive clashes, the client patron bonds meant Roman politics was more a clash of rival clans than a class war. What truly bound all Romans together, though, were unspoken rules of social and political conduct. The Romans never had a written constitution or extensive body of written law. They needed neither. Instead, the Romans surrounded themselves with unwritten rules, traditions, and mutual expectations collectively known as most myorom, which meant the way of the elders. Even as political rivals competed for wealth and power, their shared respect for the strength of the client patron relationship, the sovereignty of the assemblies, and the wisdom of the senate kept them from going too far. When the republic began to break down in the late 2nd century, it was not the letter of Roman law that eroded, but respect for the mutually accepted bonds of most myorom. Though sometimes divided internally, the Romans always fought as one when faced with a foreign threat. Romulus stamped the Romans early with a martial spirit and rarely did a year go by without some kind of conflict with a neighbor. Occasionally, these seasonal skirmishes erupted into full-blown wars, starting in 343, the Romans became locked in a long war with the Samnites, a nomadic people who populated the hills and mountains of central Italy. Waged over the next 50 years, the Samnites wars eventually sucked the rest of Italy into an anti-Roman coalition. When Rome defeated this coalition in 295, they became undisputed masters of the peninsula. But that victory only led to an even greater conflict, the Punic Wars. As Rome grew in strength during the 300s, the prosperous merchant city of Carthage had been rising in North Africa. By the time the Romans conquered Italy, the Carthaginians had pushed their way onto the island of Sicily and would soon be moving over to Spain. The two budding empires inevitably clashed, and for the next 100 years, Rome and Carthage battled for control of the Western Mediterranean. Rome was nearly defeated in 218 when the great Carthaginian general Hannibal invaded Italy, but the stubborn Romans refused to surrender. In fact, they were soon able to spread the conflict throughout the Mediterranean. In an attempt to shut down Hannibal's supply lines, the Senate sent legions to attack Carthaginian lands in Spain. When they discovered Hannibal sawed an alliance with King Philip V of Macedon, the Senate ordered a fleet to Greece. Finally, the great hero of the war, Scipio Africannus, led an invasion of the Carthaginian homeland in North Africa. There, he defeated Hannibal at the Battle of Zama in 202. Carthage surrendered. Emerging from the crucible of the Punic Wars, Rome was no longer merely a regional power. It had become the dominant power in the Mediterranean, but the Senate resisted taking direct imperial control over the territories they now commanded. The final treaty with Carthage was surprisingly lenient. It stipulated a number of punitive clauses, the Carthaginians owed an annual cash indemnity and were forbidden from fielding an army or a navy. But other than that, Carthage retained its traditional domains in Africa and was free to govern itself. The Senate also wanted no part of ruling the Greeks and Macedonians. Having successfully kept Macedon out of the war, the Roman fleet withdrew back across the Adriatic. The plan was to lead Greece to the Greeks, but, much to the Senate's consternation, King Philip V of Macedon intentionally violated a treaty obligation and Rome was obliged to send legions east again. In 197, Philip paid for his provocative miscalculation when the legions crushed him at the decisive Battle of Cynicephalai. Philip agreed to confine himself to Macedon and not make further trouble. But though Greece was now at their mercy, the victorious Romans declared in 196, the Senate of Rome and T. Quintius, their general, having conquered King Philip and the Macedonians, do now decree and ordain that these states shall be free, shall be released from the payment of tribute and shall live under their own laws. The Romans had not come to conquer the Greeks, but to set them free. But though the Senate issued direct imperial rule over the, quote, unquote, civilized Carthaginians in Greeks, they showed little hesitation annexing, quote, unquote, uncivilized Spain. Attracted by lucrative silver mines, Rome kept its legions in Spain after the Punic Wars, to ensure Spanish silver made its way into Roman temples. Roman conduct in Spain was riddled with double dealing, extortion, and periodic atrocities. This led to rapid cycles of insurrection and pacification that in turn led the Senate to formally organize the Spanish coast into two permanent provinces, near Spain and further Spain. In 197, they joined Sicily and Corsica as some of the earliest overseas provinces of the Roman Empire. This was the world into which Pueblius Scipio Amelionus was born in 185 BC. The son of an ancient patrician family, Amelionus was adopted by the childless head of the Scipione family, making him legally the grandson of the great Scipio Africana. Adoptions like this were a common way to cement alliances inside the Roman aristocracy, and Amelionus grew up inside the most powerful family in the most powerful city in the world. Raised to expect a distinguished public career, Amelionus never doubted that it was his destiny to be a great leader. In time, he would serve with distinction in all three of the Republic's principal imperial spheres, and then serve as one of the principal authors of Rome's ultimate imperial triumph. Amelionus's first taste of action came in Greece when his natural father, Lucius Amelius Paulus, brought his 17-year-old son along on campaign to observe a Rome conducted a war. In June 168, Paulus's legion crushed the Macedonians, deposing its young ambitious king Perseus who had tried to overthrow the hegemony of Rome. He watched as his father seized the Macedonian royal treasury and slaved upwards of 300,000 people and literally erased the kingdom of Macedon from the map. What had once been the kingdom of Alexander the Great was now divided into four small republics. After this harsh settlement, however, the Senate returned to their habit of ruling with a light hand. They demanded the inhabitants of the four new Macedonian republics continue to pay taxes, but at half the rate they had been paying to the kings of Macedon. If you manage to survive the war and not get sold into slavery, life under the Romans was pretty good. In the midst of his conquest, Amelius Paulus also took a thousand prominent Greeks hostage to secure the good behavior of their kin. Among them was a brilliant politician and scholar named Polybius. A civic leader from the city of Megalopolis, Polybius had counseled neutrality towards the Romans in its wars with Macedon, which was enough to mark him as a dangerous element. But though Polybius was now salated for banishment, it would prove of fortuitous calamity. When the Roman senior command passed through Megalopolis, the teenage Amelius borrowed books from Polybius and their subsequent discussions created a friendly bond. Paulus arranged for Polybius to spend his exile in Rome and tutored his son in rhetoric, history and philosophy. After Polybius' tutelage, Amelius embraced a new Greco-Roman spirit that was sweeping the age. The flood of educated Greek slaves into Italy led an entire generation of young nobles to become fully steeped in Greek literature, philosophy and art. Some more conservative Romans railed against the importation of Greek ideas and believed they eroded the austere virtues of the early Romans. But while young leaders like Amelius reveled in Greek culture, they never questioned Rome's right to rule the world. And despite conservative moral agonizing, there was nothing soft about skip you, I, Melee Honest, who believed that obedience was taught with a whip hand. He would be in a prime position to be that whip hand, when those who chaffed under Roman rule began to rise up, and the Senate decided to finally teach the Mediterranean obedience. While Polybius spent his exile in Rome, he came to admire the Roman Republic, or, at the very least, came to believe that Roman power was irresistible, and that his fellow Greeks better get used to it. An energetic observer of the world, Polybius took endless notes and maintained extensive correspondence that allowed him to make a thoroughgoing investigation of these obscure Italian barbarians who were now masters of the universe. Eventually, Polybius would write a history of Rome to explain how and why the Romans had risen so far, so fast. Pius argued that beyond their obvious military prowess, the Romans lived under a political constitution that had achieved the perfect balance between the three classical forms of government. Monarchy, rule by the one, aristocracy, rule by the few, and democracy, rule by the many. According to Aristotelian political theory, each form of government had its merits, but inevitably devolved into its most oppressive incarnation until it was overthrown. As some monarchy would become a tyranny, only to be overthrown by an enlightened aristocracy, which slid to repressive oligarchy, until popular democracy overwhelmed the oligarchs, opening the door for anarchy, and so back to the stabilizing hand of monarchy again. Polybius believed the Romans had beaten this cycle, and could thus keep growing when other cities collapsed under the shifting sands of their own inadequate political systems. The monarchical element of the Roman constitution was the executive consuls. Thanks to the Roman aversion to kings, the republic did not have a single executive, and instead elected a pair of consuls who would share supreme military, political, and religious authority. To limit the risk of a tyrannical power grab, each executive partner had the ability to veto the decisions of his colleague. But even more importantly, the term of office was just a single year. At the end of their year in office, the consuls would return to the ranks of the citizen body, and a new pair of leaders would replace them. The practical Romans however did create an emergency office called the Dictatorship. In times of crisis, the consuls could pass power to a single man who would hold absolute power in order to deliver a realm from danger. And this did not just mean foreign threats. The first dictator was appointed due to a public unrest in Rome, rather than the threat from a hostile neighbor. But critically, the Dictatorship expired after six months. As the Romans held an implacable hatred of kings, the Senate authorized any citizen at any time to kill another citizen caught seeking regal power. For nearly 500 years, Roman Dictators never failed to lay down their power. The aristocratic element was, of course, the Senate. Only 100 old men organized by Romulus to act as a council of state. The Senate numbered about 300 old men in Polybius's age. Drawing its members from the richest and most powerful families in Rome, the Senate had evolved into the Central Political Institution of the Republic. With the Senate composed of former magistrates, it served as the principal advisor for the annually elected leaders. Rarely did consuls pursue a policy without the Senate's deliberative input. Finally, the Democratic element was found in the assemblies, which were open to all Roman citizens. By the time of Polybius, there were three principal assemblies, the Centurion Assembly, which elected senior magistrates, the Tribal Assembly, which elected junior magistrates, past laws and rendered legal judgment, and the Poblian Assembly, which had many of the same powers as the Tribal Assembly, but which elected the Tribunes and were only open to men of Poblian birth. The Democratic element of the Roman Constitution is often underrated, but the assemblies were incredibly powerful. Only an assembly could enact a law or past capital sentence on a citizen, and while a citizen could always appeal a verdict to the assemblies, there was no appeal from the assemblies. Because the Greek and Roman literary sources are not always clear which of the three assemblies they are talking about, hereafter they are referred to collectively as the assembly. In Polybius' construction, the three elements of the Roman Constitution existed in a balance that prevented any one element from dominating. But though Polybius was a gifted theorist, by the time he was writing his history in the mid-100s, the balance he admired had already been disrupted. The Senate had emerged from the Punic War stronger than it had been since the first secession of the plebs in the 400s. During the Punic Wars, the annual changeover of senior military commanders became a hindrance to war planning, and the Senate collectively began to take the lead in developing and executing policy. The Senators also became adapted in ensuring subservient clients were elected Tribunes. By the end of the Punic Wars, the Consuls, the Tribunes and assemblies no longer acted as a check on the Senate, but as an extension of it. Even as Polybius wrote his PN2 Roman constitutional balance, the senatorial aristocracy was sliding into repressive oligarchy. One of the ways the Senate wielded power was by keeping tight control on who would be elected to the highest magistracies. By the mid-200s, the conflict of the orders had destroyed most distinctions between patrician and pleb. But as one elite aristocracy falls, another is always right there to take its place, and the new distinction emerged, any family, patrician or pleb that could claim a consular ancestor was now referred to as nobile. Men born without consular ancestors were derisively called novice homo, or new man. This new patrician pleb nobility worked hard to ensure that their families continued to monopolize the consulship, and new men were almost never allowed to attain a consulship. PN2's mumius was among those who felt the effects of this slide-port oligarchy. He was an ambitious young man. He was also novice homo. Almost nothing is known about mumius' early life. Even his year of birth is a mystery, and can only be calculated to have been somewhere between 200 and 190. Assuming he followed a standard trajectory, mumius would have joined the legions after finishing his education sometime between the ages of 18 and 22. One year's service and the legions was a prerequisite for public office, and mumius would have served as a cavalry officer at various provincial garrisons. After his ten year service, mumius qualified to begin his ascent up the Cursus on Norum, the path of honors, that comprised the hierarchy of elected magistracies. The first step in the Cursus on Norum was Quistor. Each year, the assembly elected ten quistors who were tasked with the republic's finances, accounting and recordkeeping. Usually acting as an assistant to a senior magistrate, the quistors spent their year in office learning the ropes of Roman administration. Election to quistorship also qualified a man to be enrolled in the senate. Though as junior officers in their early thirties, they were typically seen and not heard during the great senatorial debates. Mumius might have spent his year as quistor assigned to the state treasury in Rome, or placed on a provincial assignment to Sicily, Sardinia, or Spain. Above the quistors were Idelis. Each year, the assembly elected four Idelis, who were tasked with overseeing public works and games. A year as Idelis was a great way for a rising politician to cultivate name recognition and popularity by throwing lavish games or overseeing a high-profile project like a new road or aqueduct. Ambitious young men often took on enormous debt to fund these projects, on the understanding that their future political success would afford them opportunities to pay back their creditors. When former quistors and Idelis approached their 40th birthday, they were allowed to run for prytor and crossed the threshold from junior to senior magistracies. Since the two annual consoles could not be everywhere, each year the assembly elected four prytors, who held sovereign power when the consoles were not present. Prytors helped shoulder the responsibilities of provincial administration, military operations and judicial proceedings. Undoubtedly with the help of noble patrons who saw promise in the young officer, mumius was able to secure election as prytor for 153 BC. Given his novice homostatus, however, this was as far as mumius could reasonably expect to rise, the consulship, after all, was not a place for a new man. But a crisis in Spain helped mumius break the streak that had seen no novice homo-elected consul for a generation. The senate assigned mumius the task of restoring order in further Spain, which was reeling from a revolt by the native Lucetanians. Marching into the interior, mumius located the main body of Lucetanians and drove them back, but his army lost cohesion while chasing the rebels, allowing the Lucetanians to turn the tables. Mumius was forced to retreat all the way back to the coast. Undaunted, mumius regrouped and then proceeded to best the Lucetanians repeatedly. By the end of the year, he was sitting on top of a pile of slaves and plunder. For his victories, the senate and the people of Rome awarded mumius a triumph, a rare enough honour to begin with, almost never granted, to a novice homo. The triumph was not just an honour, it was the ultimate enroman political pageantry. A returning general would enter Rome along with his victorious troops and the spoils of war and follow a ritualized path to the temple of Jupiter on the capitaline hill. Along the way, the citizens of Rome would behold the gold, silver, jewels, exotic artifacts, trophies and slaves accumulated by the legions during the campaign. When the parade was over, the triumphant general often hosted banquets and games, the more memorable and exotic, the better. Every Roman leader jockey to be awarded a triumph, but not everyone got one. It is a testament to mumius' ability and political connections that this novice homo paraded through Roman triumph. If mumius decided to run for consul, his name was now known far and wide. If the novice homo mumius needed methodical and steady steps to climb the curses of norm, the patrician nobile skipio amelionus simply breezed along without a care in the world. Amelionus was elected quite store around 155, but prior to his consulship, that was the only official majesty he held. In 151, he volunteered to accompany the consul to Spain, where further revolts necessitated continued military engagement. While in Spain, amelionus developed a reputation for courage and physical prowess. Once he received an award for being first over an enemy wall, another time he rescued three cohorts of trapped legionaries, and then later he defeated a boastful Spanish warrior in single combat. This was the resume of a dashing young hero, and the Romans delighted in his exploits. As amelionus' popularity grew, his destiny came into focus as the sleeping giant of Carthage woke from its 50 year slumber. In 152, the aging Cato the Elder traveled to Carthage to arbitrate a dispute and was appalled at how splendid and wealthy Carthage had become since the end of the Punic Wars. Having newfound self-confidence, Cato returned to Rome and advocated immediate war to prevent the Carthage Indians from ever again threatening Rome. In every speech he subsequently delivered in the Senate, no matter the topic, Cato famously concluded by saying, furthermore, Carthage must be destroyed. The Senate finally succumbed to Cato's nagging, and in 150 they found the pretext to attack. But the defensive fortifications of Carthage were impressive, and instead of destroying the city quickly, the Romans found themselves mired in a two-year-long siege. Promise a quick and easy war, the citizens of Rome grew impatient at the Senate's inability to finish the job. In 148, they went looking for a new leader. As the consular elections approached, a movement to draft the popular Skipi Amelionus broke out in Rome. But there was a problem. Amelionus was both too young for the job, and had never served a magistracy higher than Quistor. According to both the letter and spirit of the law, Amelionus was ineligible for the consulship. But the power of the assembly was vast, and by simple majority vote, they suspended the qualifications, elected Amelionus' consul, and then dispatched him to Carthage. After arriving in the spring of 147, Amelionus set to work putting the city to a methodical siege. He walled off the harbor to prevent Carthaginian boats from slipping the Roman blockade, and built extensive siege works to finally bring the city to its knees. The year after Amelionus' irregular consular election saw another irregular election, as lukeous Mumius prepared to do the impossible. Helped by noble patrons and buoyed by the memory of his triumph, Mumius ran for the consulship of 146. It had been a full generation since the nobility let even a single ounce of new blood into their body. Mumius was deemed worthy of the honor. When he won the consulship, he was the first Novus Homo consul in almost 40 years. The Senate dispatched newly minted consul Mumius to Greece, where Roman hegemony was once again being challenged. Since their victory over Macedon in 168, the Senate continued to play an influential, but detached row in Greek affairs, acting as impartial arbitrators of political and economic disputes between various cities and kingdoms. But though the cities of the Greek East often sought Roman arbitration and guidance, that did not mean it always respected the Senate's decrees. In 148, envoys from the Achaean League, an alliance of cities and central Greece, petitioned Rome to prevent disgruntled members of the League from leaving the alliance. But when the Senate decreed that any city choosing to withdraw could do so, the leaders of the Achaean League launched a war to stop the Senate's will from being enforced. Of this inevitably doomed bid, the Geographer Palsanius said, Audacity combined with weakness should be called madness. As if that was not enough, and just as war in Greece was brewing, a pretender to the Macedonian throne launched a campaign to restore the kingdom of Macedon. When word of this latest threat from Macedon reached Rome, the Senate dispatched the Prytor, Quintus Cachelius Metallus, who made quick work of the Macedonian army, forever earning Metallus the Cognomine Macedonicus. After this latest Macedonian uprising, Rome decided they had had enough Macedonian uprisings. Instead of returning sovereignty to the native inhabitants, the Senate annexed the whole region and created a new province of the Roman Republic called Macedonia. But while the Macedonians were crushed, down in Greece the Achaeans still held out. When Lukius Mumius arrived in the spring of 146, he found the last intransigent Achaeans hold up in Corinth. Mumius took over the siege and prepared for a massive final assault. Knowing they would not be able to withstand an attack, most of the Corinthians escaped out the back. Mumius allowed the inhabitants to flee, and when the city was mostly empty, he ordered his legions to break down the gates. Likely acting on senatorial instructions, Mumius ordered his men to collect every valuable object they could find, kill or enslave any residents they came across, and then systematically demolish the city. When word came back of Corinth's destruction, the Senate dispatched a commission to Greece to settle affairs in the east for all time. After 50 years of trying to maintain the pretense of Greek liberty, the Romans finally gave up. Greece was merged with Macedon into the single Roman province of Macedonia. Greek liberty was dead. The Romans now ruled. Back in North Africa, the Romans prepared for final victory over their greatest enemy. After a year of careful preparation, Amelionus launched the final assault on Carthage in the spring of 146. The legions breached the walls and rushed into the city, but it took a week of bitter house to house fighting to subdue the last Carthaginian holdouts. When the city was finally conquered, Amelionus likely acted on the same set of instructions that had been given to Mumius. He stripped the city of its wealth, enslaved any fighters left alive, and forcibly moved the remaining inhabitants inland. He then ordered Carthage put deflaim. Soon enough a senatorial commission would arrive to annex Carthaginian territory into the domains of Rome and create a new province called Africa. But as he stood watching Carthage burn, Skipiall Amelionus reflected on the fate of this once great power. Overcome with emotion, he cried. His friend and mentor Polybius approached and asked why Amelionus was crying, what better outcome could any man hope for? Amelionus replied, a glorious moment, Polybius, but I have a dreadful boating that someday the same doom will be pronounced on my own country. According to Roman tradition, Amelionus then quoted a line from Homer, a day will come when sacred Troy shall perish and pry him and his people shall be slain. Amelionus knew that no power endures indefinitely, that all empires must fall, and that there is nothing mortals can do about it.
